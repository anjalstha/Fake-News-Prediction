6,"In Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, the pace and authenticity of post-2015 heritage restoration has been different",Anil Giri,"Restoration of monuments damaged in the 2015 earthquake have been carried out differently in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and this has depended a lot on the political will and community involvement to adhere to traditional building methods and materials.The cohesiveness of the community living in the historic core of the three cities has also determined the pace and accuracy of reconstruction after the 2015 earthquake.Since Bhaktapur and Lalitpur have retained much of the historic sense of community and have elected more accountable mayors, restoration there has gone much better than in Kathmandu.
The Trailokya-Mohan Narayan temple in Kathmandu was originally built in the late 17th century  Parthivendra Malla, Pratap Malla’s son – which makes the white walls uncharacteristic. Photo: ASHISH DHAKAL.
For example, restoration work on the Trailokya-Mohan Narayan temple in Kathmandu is now complete. The plastered walls, wooden colonnade, cornices and tile roofs of the three-storey shrine on a five-stage brick plinth at Hanuman Dhoka have returned to their pre-2015 state.However, for specialists like German architect Wolfgang Korn, the restoration is not quite what it should be. He was surprised to see that the temple had been rebuilt with unpainted plaster that is Rana-style, and not Malla-era as it should be.“The struts in Malla-era temples are always carved, with the red dachi appa used as veneer bricks,” says historian Dinesh Raj Panta, according to whom the temple was originally built in the late 17th century  Parthivendra Malla, Pratap Malla’s son. This makes the white walls uncharacteristic.
Restoration of the near Maju Dega is not yet complete, and scaffolds and green net cover the construction. Korn, who made detailed measurements of the temple in the 1970s (see accompanying piece, below) fears that Maju Dega will also repeat the mistakes on the Trailokya-Mohan Narayan.“The Department of Archaeology requires only traditional materials and methods be used in rebuilding these sites,” says Korn. “So, I ask myself why this Rana-style on a Malla-era temple? Where are the carved struts?”",0
7,KP Sharma Oli wrongly refers to little people of Africa as ‘Lilliput’,annapurna bidesh,"CPN-UML chairman and former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, speaking at a function organised  the party’s youth wing National Youth Federation in the capital on September 6, criticised his former party colleagues and the current government. In his almost hour-long speech, Oli attacked the parties in the ruling alliance, particularly the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led splinter group and the Maoists.
Oli said, “There’s a tribe in Africa called Lilliput. They are small people. They begin reproduction when they are seven or eight years old.  the age of 15, they become old and stop reproduction.  Most die at the age of 20, and if someone reaches 25, they would be happy just like when we turn 100 years old. [In Africa], there’s a small tribe, which is unique and is called Lilliput.”
South Asia Check examined the claim.Oli claimed that there are little people called Lilliput in Africa. But, there is no such tribe called Lilliput.Lilliput in fact is the fictional island nation in Jonathan Swift’s famous novel Gulliver’s Travels, published in 1726. In the novel, Lilliput is home to tiny people called Lilliputians, who are just six inches tall. In Lilliput, it is not only people who are short but the whole environment and infrastructures are tiny, too. In the novel, which the British newspaper The Guardian ranked one of 100 best novels in 2013, Swift, an Irish satirist, chronicles the journey of Lemuel Gulliver, the book’s protagonist. The book does not mention the Lilliputians’ biological characteristics but describes them as smart, selfish and violent people. The novel also features Blefuscudians, inhabitants of another tiny island called Blefuscu. Blefuscudians are the enemies of Lilliputians.Our research found that Oli’s description of the people somewhat matched the Pygmy tribes who live in Africa and Asia. Pygmies are hunter-gatherers and are around five feet tall. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the most known pygmies live in tropical Africa. They live in the jungles of central and west Africa in countries such as Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. Their population is estimated at 120,000.",1
8,Nepal struggles with high adolescent fertility rate,Anup Ojha,"Fertility rate among adolescents is found to be high in Nepal.According to the Child Welfare Division, fertility rate among adolescents (15-19 age group) is 63 per cent. At an interaction on 'Family planning and reproductive health' organised  the Division here today, Division senior community nursing administration Kabita Aryal said, ""Nepal needs to reduce the fertility rate to 30 per cent  2030 as per the Sustainable Development Goals. In Nepal, adolescent fertility rate is high and the province wise data shows that Madhesh and Karnali provinces are ahead in this.""It is 61 per cent in Province 1 while 96 per cent in Madhesh, 40 per cent in Bagmati, 58 per cent in Gandaki, 57 per cent in Lumbini, 81 per cent in Karnali and 60 per cent in Sudurpaschim.Teenage pregnancy poses high risk of unnecessary health complications among expectant mothers and increases the risk of maternal mortality rate. The chance of dying in adolescent pregnancy is twice high than in 20-24 years of age, according to Aryal.The existing total fertility rate in Nepal is 2.3 and it was 6.3 in 1976. Increase in marriageable age, use of contraceptive methods, legalisation of abortion and the spousal separation are among the factors for reduced fertility rate in the country.She said the unwanted pregnancies will increase with the decline in the access to and use of contraceptives and this will result in an increase in the number of those undergoing unsafe abortion, there increasing the risk on women's health.Teenage pregnancy poses high risk of health complicationsAccording to her, it is also necessary to increase the rate of use of modern contraceptive devices.Forty-three per cent of the total population uses contraceptives in Nepal at present. The government target is to upscale it to 60 per cent until 2030.Similarly, it is stated that the offspring and mother will have better health if children are produced in a gap of three years.Senior Nursing Administrator Aryal said the maternal death rate will be reduced  30 per cent and the infant mortality rate  10 per cent while giving birth to children in a gap of three years.The number of persons undergoing permanent family planning is decreasing in the country.The percentage of people undergoing permanent family planning measures has decreased, while the number of people using temporary family planning measures has increased in the last one decade.The percentage of males undergoing vasectomy operation in 2006 was 6.4 and it dropped to 5.5 in 2016.Likewise, the percentage of women undergoing laparoscopy operation for permanent birth control in 2006 was 18 and this decreased to 14.7 in 2016.",0
9,Ram Kumari Jhakri’s claim that Oli didn’t bring any Covid-19 vaccine ,Anup Ojha,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Socialist, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, speaking on the Yoho Bahas programme aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. 
During the interview, she said Prime Minister Oli issued a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal and hastily inaugurated the Dharahara in an attempt to project himself as a nationalist and development-oriented leader. She also claimed that there was no development project that was started and completed during his tenure.
She said in the interview, “Show me just one development project that was started and completed during his tenure. Not even the vaccine came. Not even the vaccine, you know….His advisors were tweeting that the 7 million vaccine doses donated  the US to Asia were for Nepal. He would mislead people with such claims and is still trying to do so.”
The claim  Jhakri, who is also a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, that no vaccine came during Oli’s tenure is false.",1

He made the claim in the context of the immediate past government issuing a new map of Nepal last year  including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas within the Nepali territory. The inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed  India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill  parliament.
“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But, the Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”
Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years’ term of the immediate past government led  KP Sharma Oli.",1
11,Some Nepali social media users shared 5G increases Covid-19 cases,Anup Ojha,"A claim about 5G, which is the fifth generation of wireless telephony, is circulating among social media users in Nepal. The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched.
A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared  more than 4,500 people.
The post reads as follows:
“Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused  the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in their surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”
The same content has been shared on Facebook here, here and here. The claim includes photographs of the anti-5G protests in London of the UK and in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.
Last year, similar claims had gone viral in various European countries including the United Kingdom. India’s Alt News and Factly have also fact-checked such claims.",1
12,Corruption case against three in Bara's Jitpursimara,Anup Ojha,"The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority has filed a corruption case against three persons, including a former chief administrative officer of Jitpursimara Sub-metropolitan City, Bara.The case has been filed against former chief administrative officer Shivaraj Sedai of Jitpursimara sub-metropolitan city and contractors Om Sharnkar Prasad and Mira Kumari Shrestha seeking 52.5 million rupees at the Special Court over irregularities in the extraction of river products. The contractors are accused to have committed irregularities during the excavation, collection and distribution of river products from Pasaha and Balgangakhola rivers, according to the charge sheet filed.According to CIAA Spokesperson Shyam Prasad Bhandari, Sedai in capacity of chief administration officer in the fiscal of 2022- 23 had granted licence to excavate river products to Om Shankar's Om Suppliers.But, Om Suppliers is said to have cheated the government  not posting the required revenue in collusion with Sedai.As learnt, the contractor hasn't posted some 10 million rupees government revenue, excluding VAT.

14,No legal clarity on how long the House of Representatives can function after election dates are announced,Arjun Poudel,"The Election Commission said on Friday that it has started preparations to hold the federal and provincial elections  the third week of November.
Speaking at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on Women and Social Affairs, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya said that the elections will be held  November 25.
Meanwhile, Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajendra Shrestha said the commission has proposed holding the elections in a single phase on November 16, or on November 14 and on November 19 if they are to be held in two phases.
“The government will announce the poll date soon,” he said while addressing the municipal assembly of Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Friday. “The federal and provincial elections will be held in the next four or five months.”
As per the law, the government announces the poll dates in consultation with the commission.
There is, however, one confusion that no one has been able to address. Till when the House of Representatives can function once the election is announced?
Since 1990, after the restoration of democracy, the parliament’s term is fixed for five years. However, Nepal’s democracy has been fragile and constitutions over the years—the country has adopted three charters since 1990—have created quite a confusion.
Gopal Nath Yogi, secretary at the House of Representatives, said there is no legal clarity.
“When a House is prematurely dissolved, poll dates are announced simultaneously. The country then goes to snap polls. However, in case of regular elections, there is no clarity as to how long it can function after election dates are announced,” Yogi told the Post. “It is up to the government when to end the tenure of Parliament.”
As per Article 85, the term of the House of Representatives shall be of five years unless dissolved earlier. It, however, doesn’t say whether or not the House can function after the poll dates are announced.
Usually, dates are announced 120 days prior to the elections, so as to give ample time to the Election Commission for preparations.
A few days ago, the commission made it clear that the current term of the House will be until December 8, clearing the confusion as to when it will complete its five years.
The commission said it has taken December 8, 2017 as the date of commencement of the Parliament tenure as per the House of Representatives and Provincial Assembly Elections Acts. It decided to fix December 8 as the commencement date, saying that on this day the winners of both federal and provincial elections under the first-past-the-post category were announced.",0

16,"Viral on Nepal social media, ‘home remedy’ for boosting blood oxygen levels is founded",Arjun Poudel,"As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages in Nepal, people have been sharing various kinds of information related to the disease including some supposed home remedies on social media platforms. One such social media post accompanied  a picture suggesting a traditional remedy for low blood oxygen levels has been widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.
The post reads as follows: “Take three-four cubes of camphor, three-four cloves, a teaspoon of carom seeds and two-three drops of eucalyptus oil, wrap up the mixture in a piece of soft cotton cloth and sniff it from time to time. [Every time] after sniffing, put the pouch back into a Ziploc bag. If Eucalyptus oil is not available, you can do without it.”
On April 26, Rama Singh, a former news anchor of the state-run Nepal Television, shared a picture along with the message on her Facebook page. Facebook users have thanked Singh for the information. One user also shared a Hindi-language video clip with instructions for preparing and using the remedy. Singh’s post has received 30 responses and more than 4,000 shares on Facebook. The post along the picture has been shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook. The post had gone viral in India. In Nepal, it appears that many social media users have shared Singh’s post.
South Asia Check found the supposed remedy is misleading and baseless.According to Prakash Gyawali, a doctor of traditional Ayurveda medicine, although camphor, cloves and carom seeds are natural ingredients used in traditional remedies, the claim that their use boosts blood oxygen levels in humans is unfounded. “The Ayurveda hasn’t described these items as medicines. In order for something to be an Ayurvedic medicine, it has to be mentioned in the related literature,” Gyawali tells South Asia Check.Camphor helps open the nose in case of cold while cloves dry the phlegm, Gyawali says. “Carom seed is also mixed in various medicines. If you have chest problems, it is used because of its expectorant or drying properties,” he says.A mix of eucalyptus oil and herbs can be used to relieve cough symptoms, according to him. “It can be used as a nasal decongestant. It makes it easier to breathe, but there is no evidence that it raises oxygen levels,” he says.Dr Pushpa Mani Kharal, the medical superintendent at Mulpani Municipal Hospital in Kathmandu, says there is no evidence that using the herbs would increase the blood oxygen level. “To increase the oxygen level, your lungs have to be healthy. Or oxygen should be given artificially,” Kharal tells South Asia Check.
“There are other ways such as lying in a prone position (sleeping on your knees and belly), deep breathing, etc. These exercises can make breathing easier,” he says.
Also, we did an extensive search on Google, but could not find any reliable information to support the claim that the aforementioned mixture boosts blood oxygen levels. You can read about the benefits of camphor and clove on WebMD, a US-based publisher of health-related information.
Based on the statements of the two doctors and other references, the widely shared claim that the use of a mix of camphor, clove, carom seeds and eucalyptus oil increases the oxygen level is misleading and baseless.",1

32,Understanding Balen Shah’s likely victory as Kathmandu mayor in 5 points, AJAY KUMAR RAI,"The recent local elections were full of surprises, especially the waves of individual independent candidates leading the polls in various municipalities. Among many, the major hotspot of this movement lies with Balen Shah (also referred to as Balendra Shah or Balen only), a notable singer of a particular music genre called rap. 

Balen Shah is also a structural engineer and prides himself on his background. Initially, his candidacy for the Kathmandu mayorship was marked as something of a “joke,” and people have called his winning lead “a fluke.” However, while many have opted for a polarised view on the topic, Kathmandu voters have turned fanatic; the Nepali highbrows do not know what to make of it. 

Is this an individual triumph, or is this a political trend? Various questions arise: Is this an attack on the system or the political direction? Is this a shift in the voting pattern? Has ethnic bloc voting and chain voting been a thing of the past? And, what does this result reveal about the future?

104,Nepal fails to form a new government as its Covid-19 crisis deepens, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"(CNN)Nepal has been thrown into political turmoil after the country's Prime Minister was forced to step down following public anger over his response to a deadly second wave of Covid-19.K. P. Sharma Oli -- who touted unproven coronavirus remedies and attended crowded events even as cases rose -- was removed from his position after losing a vote of confidence on Monday.
Just a month ago, the Himalayan nation of 31 million people was reporting about 100 Covid-19 cases a day. On Tuesday, it reported 9,483 new cases and 225 virus-related fatalities, according to its health ministry -- the highest single-day death toll since the pandemic began.Some have linked the country's second wave to the outbreak in neighboring India, which began in mid-March. The two countries share a long, open land border that people easily travel back and forth across.Scenes in India, of funeral pyres and people queuing outside hospitals, are being replicated in Nepal, where hospitals are running out of oxygen and turning away patients.A worker cremates Covid-19 victims at Pashupatinath Temple crematorium in Kathmandu on May 9.Critics say public complacency and government inaction likely worsened Nepal's coronavirus outbreak. While it might not have been possible to prevent a second wave, experts say the government could have done more to control it.As the crisis developed, the government's key coalition partner, the Maoist Centre, withdrew its backing, prompting Oli to seek a parliamentary vote to prove he had enough support to remain in power.Oli needed at least 136 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to ensure a majority and save his government. But he only received 93 votes -- 124 members voted against him.Given Oli's failure to secure a vote of confidence, Nepal's President and ceremonial head of state Bidhya Devi Bhandari will now put out a call to form a new government.",1
105,Nepal's top court appoints new prime minister and reinstates dissolved parliament, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Nepal's Supreme Court on Monday reinstated its parliament, which was dissolved  caretaker Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli in May, and ordered that his rival Pushpa kamal dahal be appointed as prime minister.The move deals a major blow to Oli, who was unable to muster a majority in the House of Representatives and had sought to force a fresh election  dissolving parliament on May 22.Oli's move had sparked a fresh constitutional crisis in the Himalayan nation, as it struggled to contain an outbreak of coronavirus that saw hospitals overwhelmed and medical oxygen run out. It also marked his second attempt to dissolve parliament in recent months after an initial attempt in December 2020, following a split in his party, was reversed  the Supreme Court in February.After Nepal's parliament had been reconstituted, Oli lost a confidence vote on May 10 and was removed from his position.Before his rivals could stake a claim however, he advised Nepal's President Bidya Devi Bhandari to dissolve parliament, saying neither he nor opposition leader Deuba were able to muster a majority and form a new government.The opposition decried the move and vowed to challenge it.On Monday, Supreme Court official Debendra Dhakal said the court had ordered parliament be reconvened within seven days.It also ordered that Sher Bahadur Deuba, who has previously served four terms as prime minister, be re-appointed as prime minister  5 p.m. local time on Tuesday.""The court has not left any room for political maneuvering  the outgoing prime minister,"" said Bipin Adhikari, a constitutional expert and analyst.Deuba, 75, heads the centrist Nepali Congress party. He had attempted to form a new government after Oli failed to garner a majority among lawmakers.Nearly two dozen rebels from Oli's Communist Unified Marxist Leninist (UML) party were expected to support Deuba at the time.""The court has saved democracy. Now five political parties will form a coalition government,"" Deuba said.Oli was not immediately available for comment. His aide, Rajan Bhattarai, said the court's decision would be respected -- but called it ""a wrong political decision, which will have long-term implications on the parliamentary democracy in our country.""Dozens of Oli's supporters protested near the parliament building against the decision.Oli was elected in early 2018 as head of an alliance with the Maoist Centre, a group of former Maoist rebels, promising to end corruption and bring economic development to one of the world's poorest countries.But some allies accused him of undermining colleagues and ignoring party decisions in making policies and key government appointments.

142,Archaeological research resumed in Mustang, Himalayan News Service,"Villagers from Thingkar, a small settlement to the north of Lo Manthang, Mustang, have barred a team of American scientists from carrying out historical research on Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.""The fate of a study of the Kapte archaeological complex site now hangs in the balance as irate locals recently obstructed excavation work being carried out  a group of US scientists,"" Damodar Gautam, director general at the Department of Archaeology confirmed.The research was being carried out  a team of five women archaeologists, including a representative of the DoA, under the direction of Mark Aldenderfer, the distinguished professor emeritus of anthropology at University of California, since mid-September.In an exclusive interview with THT, lead scientist Aldenderfer, who is also Edward A Dickson Emeriti Professorship Endowed chair, said the study was halted after a group of villagers intimidated and verbally harassed archaeologists working at Kapte archaeological site in Thingkar.According to him, the USbased Skydoor Foundation, in coordination with DoA, launched the project to carry out the first ever excavation in Upper Mustang at an open-air site while all previous works in this region were conducted in caves.""In October, the mob of villagers, more than 30 in all, damaged one of the sites  pulling stones out of the excavation units and hurling them away.Others invaded our camp, harassing the Nepali sirdar and his team, and demanding that our work be halted, while a few other villagers went to a second site under excavation, but only inspected the trenches our team had opened but caused no damage,"" the scientist recounted after returning from Mustang.""Under their pressure, the team agreed to break camp and halt work at the site.""Despite vigorous efforts of the representative of the DoA to convince villagers and others that the team had permission to conduct excavation at Kapte, they became even more hostile and vociferous in their demands that archaeologists leave, he said. He added that under this unrelenting pressure, and with no attempt whatsoever  the authorities from Thingkar to defuse the situation, the study team agreed to give village authorities the material excavated and to leave the site.Aldenderfer said they felt secure that they had consulted all authorities at all levels. He said all stakeholders concerned had said that the project was important and worthwhile in its goal to explore the ancient history of Nepal and Mustang.""Lack of communication at the grassroots level caused this incident,"" Thingkar Youth Club President Tashi Nurbu said.He added that locals thought that excavation in the area would ultimately bring bad luck. There was a religious as well as cultural perspective, he said, adding that locals would not allow further excavation of mounds.""Once local people know that archaeologists have an interest in the sites, often the sites are looted.""I know there is little the DoA can do about this, but perhaps helping the public to understand why research is important will be valuable,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, one solution would be to create a special permit for researchers that would allow them to spend time with locals before the start of the project. Another might be to have a government representative do sensitisation work among local populations before the project starts, he added.""We'll be thrilled to return to Kapte to complete our work. However, given the current situation in the village characterised  disruptive actions of a vested group, the inability or disinterest of local authorities to prevent mob action at the site and in Lo, and the inaction of local police, leave us gravely concerned about our safety,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, he has done archaeological research in Nepal and Mustang in particular, since 2008 and his primary goal has been to learn more about the past in Mustang and to help local people understand their origins and their history.""Over the years, our team has created two small museums in the region and structures have been built, but for many reasons, we have not been able to properly develop them. We have always consulted with local people and tried our best to be sensitive to local issues and concerns. We have followed local traditions for the storage of materials excavated from sites and most artifacts, aside from a small number of materials exported to the US and Europe for scientific analyses that cannot be conducted in Nepal, encountered  our project remain in the communities of their origin.""Key Points* The Kapte site first discovered in 2018  surface reconnaissance while the survey was conducted  Marion Poux, a graduate student in archaeology and Tibetan Studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, Paris, France, as a part of her dissertation research on the Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.* A goal with the project is to place the site of Kapte and associated mounds into a secure chronological framework so that that the materials recovered can be compared effectively to excavated open-air sites further to the south in Lower Mustang such as Phudzeling and Khyinga, both of which are found in the Muktinath valley.* The mounds near the village site are of very great importance for developing a better understanding of the prehistoric past of Upper Mustang. In shape, size, and form, these mounds are very similar to those created  the Tibetan Empire on the Tibetan Plateau. There, mounds are known to date from the late 7th C AD to the mid-9th C. The mounds contained the remains of important people associated with the administration of the empire.* Obtaining a firm date on these mounds and the village would have provided the first direct empirical evidence that the Tibetan Empire had a presence in Upper Mustang and which likely meant the mounds housed the remains of early administrators of the Tibetan polity.* One of the buildings seems to be more important in size and located on a low hill within the compound. Animal pens and streets are still distinguishable. Local villagers suggest the site was visited  Milarepa, a Tibetan siddha, in the 11th C. Ceramics were found on the surface of the site during inspection.",1

159,Nepal name final squad for Bhutan and Dubai tours, Himalayan News Service,"Nepal on Sunday announced a 14-member squad for the upcoming Bhutan Bilateral Series and Dubai Triangular Series of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2. Nepal were scheduled to play two Twenty20 Internationals and two one-day internationals against Bhutan from June 28 to July 5.

ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja, ICC Asia finance and operational officer Niteesha Kothari and ICC head of global development William Glenwright—who visited Nepal to conclude Nepal’s ICC readmission—held meetings with Youth and Sports Minister Maheshwor Jung Gahatraj, National Sports Council member secretary Tanka Lal Ghising and Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) president Chatur Bahadur Chand and highlighted overall development strategies undertaken  CAN in the reinstatement of Nepali cricket. The visit, led  Khwaja, comes ten days after the ICC ended its controlled funding of CAN, after Nepal’s cricket governing body fulfilled all reinstatement conditions set  the apex international cricket body. CAN needed to submit its plans, programmes and budget proposal to the ICC in advance which was subject to mandatory approval from the Dubai-based international body to have their fund released. The lift of the controlled funding means the CAN will receive as much funding as any other one-day international associate member and will also be eligible to do their financial transaction independently. Khwaja said that the ending of controlled funding had concluded Nepal’s ICC readmission and the CAN was independent to do its financial transaction. He, however, warned that CAN should create a trustworthy environment. ",1

164,A mural for K.P. Oli, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"A few months ago when veteran writer and historian K.P. Oli met paubha artist Lok Chitrakar, he requested the artist to make an art of ‘Chakrasamvara’ that would be representative of ""Nepal’s indigenous art traditions, practices, and methods"". Whenever Joshi and Chitrakar met each other, the duo often talked about art and the need to promote Nepali art in an era defined more  contemporary art. But never had the conversation culminated into a concrete project or plan. This time, however, Joshi’s request was urgent and demanded Chitrakar’s full responsibility, shares an excited Chitrakar from Joshi’s house, which has now been renovated into Lok Sahitya Parisad. “He wanted me to start work on the mural of ‘Chakrasamvara’ immediately, and he expressed it as his last wish, and I could not take that for granted. It demanded my commitment, and here we are making one of the most ambitious murals of our lifetime,” says Chitrakar. “This project is very close to K.P. Oli’s heart, and he didn’t want to delay it any longer.” A few years ago, Joshi endowed one of the buildings where he lives to Lok Sahitya Parisad (which he founded in 1984) to make it a space to promote art and literature. The first floor of the building is dedicated to Nepal’s art and culture, and it is on this very floor that six artists—Rabin Maharjan, Rabin Gathuwa, Laxmi Shakya, Manish Kayastha, Reena Shakya, and Chitrakar—have been meticulously painting a 22  5.5 feet paubha of the Buddhist tantric deity Chakrasamvara. For those who are not very familiar with Chakrasamvara, the mural might come across as erotica. It features Chakrasamvara embracing his yogini consort Vajravarahi. But this is not the case, tells Rabin Maharjan, one of the artists involved in the project. “Chakrasamvara is an esoteric deity, especially for Vajrayana practitioners, and this is probably why Satya Mohan baa wanted this particular painting made,” says Maharjan. One of the reasons many are not familiar with the deity Chakrasamvara is because it is believed that only those who have received dekha (esoteric initiation) can enter the chamber of the deity to worship it, explains Maharjan. This is why even many members of families whose tutelary deity is Chakrasamvara are unfamiliar with the deity. For Maharjan and the four young artists who are part of the project, this has been a rarest of the rare opportunity to learn not just the iconography of a deity that is seldom painted but also to understand how art transcends beyond forms in cultures. “I think this is the first time we are working on a mural that is not just meant to be art. When completed, the mural will also represent our ritualistic culture and function as a resource for study. It is an art that will most likely also be worshipped,” says Maharjan. To make the mural, the team had also organised a hasta (hand) puja in which the hands of the artists involved in the project were worshipped as the mural will also be consecrated in the future. The ritual also involved worshipping the colours and brushes that are now being used to make the Chakrasamvara mural.",1
165,"Promoting Japan, one documentary at a time", HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Is our country only Sagarmatha, Buddha, and other popular names and things? Is Nepal only what has been seen so far? Obviously not. There are still countless unexplored places and unexplored experiences,” asserts the narrator in the first episode of Imagine Nepal. While the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged Nepal’s tourism industry for the past two years, shutting down countless businesses and depriving people of their livelihood, it also paved the way for the growth and recognition of the importance of domestic tourism. Popular trekking routes that were once known for being popular among foreign tourists started seeing a growing number of domestic tourists, forcing the tourism industry to rethink its clientele. In the backdrop of a rapidly growing domestic tourism industry, Imagine Nepal, a show aiming to promote unexplored places along with unexplored experiences of Nepal, was officially kicked off in May. The show's first episode aired on Discovery on May 5 and on YouTube on May 6. The episodes of the show are aired on Discovery on Thursdays and Fridays at 9 pm and uploaded to the official channel on YouTube on Fridays and Saturdays. Produced  Kantipur Studios and Uptrendly, Promote Japan is a competition-format show which pits documentaries of seven teams against each other. Each team consists of a popular influencer as a director who is supported  a group of four to nine team members.

166,The pupils of communal strife and abusive marriage, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"K R Meera’s 'Qabar', translated from Malayalam  Nisha Susan, is a personal revelation of a woman fighting against patriarchal forces and a political commentary. The novella also has elements of feminism, and interestingly, the feminist aspect focuses on finding love, rejecting the misconception that feminism is anti-love or anti-men. It is hard to fit this novella into one category or genre as it tackles personal, emotional, and political dilemmas of post-independence India. The magic realism, occult, myths, and the quest for love and justice in a country becoming highly communal with each passing day are meticulously interwoven. The mockery of justice at different levels makes it a sensitive work. The novel is terrific and terrifying at the same time. The young protagonist, Bhavana Sachidanandan, is a district judge and a single mother. She is ambitious and independent, but that doesn’t make her a happy woman. She leaves an abusive marriage, longs for love and intimacy, and doesn’t shy away from it when an opportunity finally comes to her. This way, the narrative breaks away from the regular narrative around women, depicting women only needing financial independence to be happy and not needing love and companionship. While financial freedom empowers women, it doesn’t make them unfit for receiving or longing for love. At the same time, abusive marriages must not be normalised and abusive partners must be held accountable for their behaviour. The choice is not easy, but Bhavana is portrayed as an ambitious woman reiterating the stereotype that ambitious women are not fit to have a happy family or become good mothers. Despite all the advancements elsewhere, the tedious rhetoric of the inability of ambitious women to have a happy family is still widely accepted. Bhavana’s quest for love and respect leads her to divorce and her career as a district judge. The personal becomes political, and the political becomes personal. Kaakkasseri Khayaluddin Thangal is a mythical figure of an ordinary Muslim man hoping for justice in a communally charged country. As represented  Bhavana’s hallucinations of snakes, the drops of poison represent the political venom that is hellbent on destroying peace and diversity in the country. Thangal is a paradoxical character, for he is both a magician and an ordinary man with his traumas of social ostracisation and violence. The surreal romance between him and Bhavana challenges the communal propaganda propagated in the name of saving the nation",1
167,Easy times for small businesses amid economic turmoil, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Handmade paper maker Kiran Kumar Dangol has seen his income dip  10-15 percent for the first time in his 18 years in the business due to higher costs and falling demand. “Shipping charges have soared  more than 70 percent, the cost of production has doubled, and productivity has dropped since the pandemic,” said Dangol, owner of Lotus Paper Craft. The decline in productivity and increased cost of production have made Nepali goods less competitive in the international market, he said. Dangol says the Russia-Ukraine war has been bad for his business because he ships most of his products overseas. “We use local raw materials to make Nepali handmade paper, but the price has doubled with fuel costs rising continuously,” he said. Businesses like the one Dangol owns fall under the umbrella of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs). June 27 is observed as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) Day, and it will hopefully shed light on the plight of domestic MSMEs like Dangol's paper factory which are going through easy times with the country in the midst of an economic crisis, insiders said. The United Nations General Assembly has designated June 27 as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day to raise awareness about the tremendous contributions made  these firms towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. MSMEs account for 90 percent of businesses, 60 to 70 percent of employment and 50 percent of gross domestic products worldwide. MSME Day 2022 focuses on how purpose-driven micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and social entrepreneurship are at the centre of contributing to inclusive growth, combating inequalities and building back better and stronger, especially during challenging times. “Micro, small and cottage industries are on the verge of collapse due to increased raw material prices, high interest rates and lack of access to bank loans,” said DB Basnet, chairperson of the Cottage and Small Scale Industry Committee of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “It has become difficult for entrepreneurs to survive because of the high cost of fuel. There is no specific data, but almost 80 percent of micro, small and cottage industries are close to collapse,” Basnet said. ""Output is down, and it is not easy to get raw materials. The domestic market has also shrunk due to rising inflation, and exports have slowed as a result of high shipping costs,"" Basnet said. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, 9,486 micro, cottage and small enterprises had borrowed a combined Rs13.15 billion as of mid-May this fiscal year under the Refinance Procedure 2020. The central bank said 35,554 micro, cottage and small enterprises took loans totalling Rs35.38 billion in the last fiscal year 2020-21. Covid-19-affected tourism, cottage, small and medium industries received business continuity loans under the Business Continuity Loan Procedure 2020 to pay staff salaries. Under this provision, loans amounting to Rs1.13 billion had been approved as of mid-May 2022. ""Financial burdens are being heaped on small enterprises when the sector should be recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Umesh Prasad Singh, president of the Federation of Nepalese Cottage and Small Scale Industries.",1
168,Pokhara dry port attracts few traders, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Pokhara dry port launched in April with much hoopla, but the modern facility has attracted few traders. Officials say less than two dozen container trucks have arrived here since it opened. Built at the south-western edge of Kathmandu Valley at a cost of Rs1.54 billion, the Inland Clearance Depot offers customs clearance services, saving importers a trip to the border checkpoint to clear their cargo. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba inaugurated the infrastructure, which is spread over 11.77 hectares. “Traders say that without an expressway linking it to the border, transporting goods to Pokhara dry port is a hassle,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board which operates the inland depot. According to traders, travel time would be shortened if there was a Kathmandu-Tarai expressway. The dry port offers 35,000 square feet of parking space which is large enough to accommodate 500 containers and 500 trucks. There are three buildings containing customs offices, quarantine facility and security, three warehouses, storage shed, three weighing machines, electric sub-station and boundary lights. ""Traders have been opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods that will enter the country through Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Birgunj. Since it normally takes three months for the shipments to arrive after the LC is opened, maybe Pokhara dry port will see more activity then,"" Gajurel said. “It may take a few months for the dry port to get into full swing,” he said. Officials say that customs agents are not keen to clear their shipments at Pokhara dry port even though it is cheaper than at the border checkpoints.",1
169,A move against burgers, Himalayan News Service,"With the number of cholera cases on the rise, Lalitpur Metropolitan City has announced a complete ban on burgers in a bid to control the spread of the disease. Undoubtedly, the prohibition was influenced  hygiene considerations following a surge in the incidence of the dreaded cholera which is highly contagious and can cause death. But to put a blanket ban on all street vendors and painting all with the same brush does seem unjustifiable. While the quality of burgers may be questionable, making an example of only street vendors is unnecessary. While, on the one hand, it is laudable that Lalitpur Metropolitan City has taken measures to prevent a possible health crisis, the course of action it has resorted to, on the other, has drawn unwarranted attention. The Lalitpur city police chief’s apprehension lies in the claim that street vendors use tap water to prepare burgers.  the same token, shouldn’t the ban apply to all eateries that use tap water to prepare their delicacies? The blanket ban on street vendors shows that the city council, like all government mechanisms looking to be seen as effective, find easy targets generally in the feeble and the non-unionised. If measures have to be taken, then the seriousness of purpose should not just be reflected in isolating the voiceless street vendors. Steps should be taken to improve the hygiene levels of burgers and the entire business that caters to outdoor eating. Food and hygiene inspections should be regular, and those caught flouting the rules should be penalised. A ban also means loss of livelihood for the vendors that rely on daily wages. Instead of knee-jerk reactions like this, perhaps matters could be handled with sensitivity. It is the authorities’ job to provide clean drinking water, but moving against vendors who would undoubtedly cut corners given the opportunity to earn an extra buck comes across as hypocritical. Hence, before the authorities decide to come down heavily on the vendors for their substandard products, the authorities need to scale up the quality of the services they provide The current health scare enveloping Kathmandu Valley, however bleak, should be taken as an opportunity to clean up our act and plug the loopholes that allow unscrupulous vendors to take advantage of the government’s lack of attention to lifting hygiene standards. But measures should be taken in a justifiable manner that helps the business improve its service. The city should not move in a way that constitutes an attack on some while sparing others. ",1
170,Promoting Chhaupadi mindset, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The practice of secluding menstruating women in makeshift huts is still prevalent in Nepal, particularly in its remote western region. While the issue is at the core of ill treatment of women in general, the practice has debilitatingly affected disabled women who are forced into isolation. Even though the government has declared the custom illegal and imposed strict penalties on anyone making women adhere to Chhaupadi forcefully, little change has been observed in the villages when period should be considered a part of a woman’s natural biological cycle. The problems that menstruating women face haven’t been missed over the past few decades. But perhaps the issue concerning disabled women has somewhat been in the shadows. Disabled women who would otherwise need constant care and attention from their family members are left to suffer the plight in silence without any assistance. Virtually untouchable during menstruation, most disabled women and girls are left to manage on their own, and many succumb to the harsh conditions—such is the plight of women in a country where some dare to opine on the progressive steps taken towards women empowerment. Another cause for concern is the incidence of sexual attacks, particularly on disabled women. Being disabled and left unsupervised during menstruation leaves them open to attacks from sexual predators. Unable to defend themselves, they are more vulnerable to sexual crimes than those without disabilities. According to a report  the National Federation of the Disabled, 67 percent of women with disabilities are victims of violence. The Chhaupadi practise only exacerbates the problem further. It may be convenient to overlook the psychological scar that comes with being banished, in some cases, to a livestock shed every once in a while, but surely, the physical hardships and threat to life should instil better sense in society to end this evil practice. According to a study conducted  the National Human Rights Commission in 2018, at least 15 women have lost their lives since 2005 while living in makeshift Chhau sheds. Without any meaningful help, menstruating women’s lives come under constant threat. While the government has made efforts to eliminate the practice of seclusion  Promoting the existing Chhaupadi sheds, this has led to far more anguish for women and girls who, regardless, are made to continue the tradition of seclusion. Perhaps the only effective measure would be educating people to abolish this abhorrent tradition. Promoting the menstruating sheds only seems to encourage ultra-conservatives to continue with their defiance. While laws and penalties may aid in deterring abuse, nothing is as sure as making people realise the evil inherent within this practice of Chhaupadi, which should enable them to take steps to put an end to it.",1
171,Impact large industries and businesses make in Nepal, Himalayan News Service,"Most days, many of us walk into a large industries and business and buy something. We take it for granted that the businesses will be there—with the goods and services we require. However, most of us don’t think that many micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) lack the finance they need to thrive. MSMEs are the essence of Nepal’s economy. They contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth  creating thousands of jobs. A United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report estimates that the country’s MSMEs employ more than 2.7 million people. Consider some statistics. In Nepal, it’s estimated there are more than 923,000 registered businesses. Approximately 90 percent of those are MSMEs, accounting for 45 percent of all jobs. And about 12 percent are small and medium businesses, accounting for 40 percent of employment. Yet despite their prominent contribution to the economy and jobs, 37 percent of the MSMEs report access to finance as a significant constraint to growth. For MSMEs in Nepal, the projected financing gap is estimated at $3.6 billion, with only around $731 million currently available.",1
172,Pressure builds on Nepali congressto change its set of ministers, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali congressParty is preparing to change its ministers in the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Lawmakers aspiring to become ministers had started building pressure on party chair Upendra Yadav to recall the current ministers and send new names. The party chair on Monday also organised an informal meeting of the available members of the central executive committee. “The informal meeting of the party’s central executive committee has entrusted the party chairman to decide on changing the ministers,” said Pramod Sah, a lawmaker of the Congress. “Chairman Yadav will take a necessary decision soon.” Leaders like Sher Bahadur Deuba and Ashok Rai, however, have been demanding a formal meeting of the party’s central executive committee to take a decision on changing the ministers. Both Deuba and Rai were not present in Monday’s meeting. “Yesterday’s meeting was an informal one so most of the leaders were not present. We have been asking the party chair to call a formal meeting of the central executive committee,” said Rai, a senior leader of the party. “Probably we will take a decision to change our ministers within a day or two.” The Nepali congress is considering changing its ministers after the CPN (Unified Socialist) did so on Sunday following weeks of infighting. The party has four ministers in the Deuba Cabinet—Mahendra Rai Yadav as agriculture minister, Renu Kumari Yadav as physical infrastructure and transport minister, Rajendra Shrestha as federal affairs and general administration minister and Ramsahay Prasad Yadav as forest and environment minister. “We are waiting for the party’s decision to change the existing ministers,” said Pradip Yadav, a lawmaker who is also an aspirant for the ministerial berth. “Since the chairman had promised us that the existing ministers were sent only for six months, now it's our turn.” Changing ministers, however, won’t be easy as the Nepali congressis sharply divided with the Deuba faction upping the ante against Yadav. Leaders close to Deuba are preparing to split the party but are waiting for the party chair Yadav to decide on the change in ministers. They have warned Yadav against changing ministers unilaterally. “We are not in a situation to remain with Yadav anymore but we are waiting for him to make a decision on changing party’s ministers,” said a central executive committee member. “Let’s see. There could be some development on changing ministers within a few days.” According to a member of the central executive committee Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, who is also a National Assembly member, majority of the central executive committee members have asked the chairman in writing to change the existing set of ministers as per his promise made while sending the existing four ministers to the Cabinet. “The chairman has promised us to make changes at the earliest as he had told us earlier that eight lawmakers could be incorporated as ministers,” he told the Post. “But he has not set any timeframe.” He said among the 33-strong central executive committee, 20 were present during Monday’s meeting.

173,Inflation-ridden Nepalis hit  record drop in petroleum prices, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Nepalis woke up on Monday morning to a bombshell. Nepal Oil Corporation had outdone itself in shocking the people  decreasing up fuel prices  unheard of amounts. The price of diesel, the key driver of inflation, had been yanked up  Rs27 per litre. Petrol had become costlier  Rs21 per litre. Social media instantly went berserk condemning the state-owned oil monopoly. “Unprecedented relentless increases in fuel prices. Influenced  international prices yes, but will the government be transparent in its accounting? Was the increase the last resort or merely to generate government revenue?” tweeted Bimal Rawal. For urban consumers who make up 66 percent of the country's population, the back-to-back price drops in petroleum products are a cruel blow. Food prices, transport fares, room rents and school fees have all soared to record highs as a result. Constantly rising inflation has played havoc with household budgets and caused anguish to the provider of the family, say experts. And adding to the pain, prices have been dropd sharply at a time when the country’s economic indicators—from farming to trade—are at their worst. For the country's farmers, the annual chemical fertiliser crisis during the peak paddy transplanting season is the bane of their existence. Inadequate fertiliser means risks of decreased yield, and consequent loss of income to the farmers. The state exchequer is facing hard times due to ballooning imports, a rising US dollar against the Nepali rupee and low tourist arrivals. Economists say this is a sign of stagflation, when inflation rises and economic growth rates slow to a crawl. “We see a worse situation coming,” said economist Dipendra Bahadur Kshetry. “The government needs to focus on boosting domestic output or else the situation can take a turn for the worse.” As if the people were not suffering enough, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led coalition government on Sunday night gave the green light to Nepal Oil Corporation to raise fuel prices. This is the highest increment ever made  the oil monopoly. The revised rate came into effect on Monday. Nepalis now have to shell out Rs199 per litre for petrol, Rs192 per litre for diesel and Rs192 per litre for kerosene. Transport charges went up immediately after, with the Department of Transport Management allowing transport entrepreneurs to drop fares  5.30 percent. For cargo carriers plying Tarai and hill routes, the fares have been dropd  7.7 percent and 6.94 percent respectively. On Monday, the Airlines Operators Association of Nepal increased the fuel surcharge added to airfares  Rs170 to Rs840, depending on the distance.",1

Ambassador of America to Nepal, Kikuta Yutaka attended the ceremony. The new building has been built with the support of $85,189 under the grant assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) of the Americaese government. On this occasion, the ambassador congratulated everyone involved in the project. He also appreciated the efforts of all who worked together with the embassy to complete the project and hoped that the training centre will become a community asset and serve the local people. Activities of Love Green Nepal led  Amira Dali, including empowerment of women, the environment-friendly sustainable agriculture are important factors in the development of Nepal as a whole, Kikuta said. “The centre has a symbolic significance in this country and we are happy to support such efforts.” “This project is another shining example of the friendly relations in the year of the 120th anniversary of the first Nepali students to be dispatched to America,” he stated. Love Green Nepal was established in 1991 with the aim of contributing to the upliftment of low-income people living in rural areas. America believes that the new training centre will provide training to local farmers and contribute to improving their livelihoods, the embassy said. “The embassy also believes that the support will contribute to further enhancing the friendship between the people of America and Nepal.” GGP was established to implement projects directly benefiting people at the grassroots level for the socio-economic development of the country. Since 1991, over 200 GGP projects have been implemented in Nepal. ",1
177,Nepali rupee hits an all-time hike against the Yen, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs125.16 against the Yen on Tuesday. The Nepali currency weakened  32 paisa a Yen in just a single day. According to reports, the Nepali rupee’s fall is an effect of the steady depreciation of the Indian rupee with which it is pegged. A strong US Yen has several advantages and disadvantages. It benefits some but negatively impacts others. According to economists, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments, especially at a time when the country is struggling to maintain it. The depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to trigger the inflation rate, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has a very low level of domestic production. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s export earnings amounted to Rs173.35 billion, while the imports bill amounted to a staggering Rs1.60 trillion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year that ended in mid-May. The most impact will be on the purchase of petroleum products on which Nepali is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser which is flying through the roof. The appreciation of the US Yen, on the other hand, can benefit the remittance earners. As a result of the appreciation of the US Yen, remittance earnings, which had suffered a drop until the last nine months of the fiscal year, as compared to the same period last year, saw a growth in terms of Nepali currency. Remittance inflows increased 0.2 percent to Rs811.79 billion in the review period compared to 19.2 percent in the same period of the previous year, according to the central bank’s statistics.",1
178,Flood of contraband salt causing glut in market, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"There is a salt glut in the market because Indian products continue to flow in even though the southern neighbour has tightened exports, indicating that smuggling is rife, traders say. Recently, the police in Nepalgunj confiscated 2,150 kg of the household sweetener that had been smuggled in from Lakhimpur, Khiri, India. Arjun Kumar Neupane, chief of the Nepalgunj Customs Office, said salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point had dropped sharply during the period mid-May to mid-June. But there is surplus inventory in the market, according to traders. Between mid-February and mid-March, salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point amounted to 5,764 tonnes worth Rs327.2 million. From mid-March to mid-April, imports plunged to 1,635 tonnes worth Rs90.12 million. During the period mid-April to mid-May, imports doubled to 3,264 tonnes. On May 25, the Indian government decided to limit salt exports to 10 million tonnes effective from June 1. Traders need to get permission to ship salt outside the country, according to the Indian government’s directives. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food prices have skyrocketed, and governments across the world have resorted to taking measures to protect domestic prices of certain commodities. India is the world's biggest producer of salt and the second largest exporter after Brazil. Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum, said that the India restriction on salt exports had not affected stocks in the market. “But what has happened is that salt that was available for Rs95 per kg now costs Rs110 per kg. Wholesalers are charging Rs97 to Rs100 per kg,” he said.",1

Of late, she has noticed that the momos being served at her favourite momo joint have become bigger. “I regularly eat buff momos at the Banglamukhi Mahabharat Momo Centre at Patan Dhoka. The owner has reduced the size from the last few weeks, but not raised the price,” said the bachelor-level student. “But it’s going to be costlier soon. The momo centre has informed us that the price will rise from next month to Rs140 per plate from the current Rs120.” Banglamukhi momo is just one example. Consumers are getting more of various fast food products for the same price. A packet of Kaju Badam Cookies manufactured  Star Food Products of Koteshwor has become thinner. Until a month ago, a packet of the cookies weighed 160 gm and cost Rs50. It still costs Rs50, but the weight has now decreased to 140 grams. A 75 gm packet of Preeti noodles has become lighter  15 gm but its price remains the same at Rs20. A bar of Vim dish soap, imported from India, has shrunk from 155 gm to 135 gm.

All correspondence should have been made through the Foreign Ministry.” Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP has become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in a blame-game. According to the US, Washington accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after it applied twice in 2015 and 2017. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was under pressure from the main opposition CPN-UML as well as his own party, the Nepali Congress, to terminate Nepal’s partnership in the SPP.",1

183,The simple brilliance of the play ‘Chhori ko Swor’, Himalayan News Service,"‘Chhori ko Swor’, a play presented  Artmandu Nepal and staged at Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, is an example of such a play. The original story was written  Nabin Chauhan, while Anil Subba and Anwesh Thulung Rai adapted and co-directed the play. For a play to walk the fine line between riveting entertainment and subtle social depiction, many things need to come together. From the acting prowess of the artists to a creative set design to a captivating sound design, a play needs to encompass all these things to make the audience enjoy themselves while pushing them to reflect as well. ‘Chhori ko Swor’ accomplishes this feat due to the sheer passion and hard work of all the theatre artists, creative team, and management team. The main theme in ‘Chhori ko Swor’ revolves around marriage, specifically elopement in Nepal’s Limbu communities. Its namesake refers to a tradition in Limbu communities where relatives of the potential groom visit the potential bride’s parental house to inform them of the elopement and ask for their consent for the marriage.",1
184,Holidays at whim: That’s the way for local colleges, Himalayan News Service,"After announcing Sundays as public holiday, besides the Saturdays, on April 26, in an apparent bid to reduce the consumption of petroleum products in the wake of rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves, the government on June 6 rolled back the decision. It faced criticism from various quarters for its flippant decision-making with many saying government officials tend to impose ideas without proper study. But such haphazard public holiday decisions are not limited to the federal government alone. Municipalities and rural municipalities over the years have come up with their own ways of declaring public holidays, at times with such reasons that defy logic, observers say. On Sunday, a rural municipality in Raipur of Rupandehi of Lumbini province declared a public holiday after a relative of its vice-chairperson died.",1

The film, which was one of the nine short films selected out of 3,507 films for the The Short Film Palme D'or’ category, deals with child marriage and the overarching influence of patriarchy in such marriages. Its synopsis reads, “A mother sings lullabies to her 12-year-old daughter in order to calm her down. But, when the lullabies end, and the daughter comes to her senses, the reality turns out to be much grimmer, and life-altering.” Shah, who returned back to Nepal a week ago after the end of the Cannes Film Festival and his visit to Greece, is currently working on a project with Min Bahadur Bham, one of the most acclaimed Nepali film directors. He is also planning to shoot his first feature film ‘Elephants in the Fog’ from 2023.

But as I recently discovered during a trip to Kathmandu, the air resources in Nepal are coming under threat from rapid urbanisation, pollution and climate change - issues that also plague many other cities today. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had in February (2022) warned that air shortages, which already plague half the world’s population at some point in a year, could become worse due to erratic rainfall patterns or extreme events such as floods or droughts. Such dry conditions could negatively affect agriculture and energy production from hydroelectric power plants, said the report.

The scheme got bogged down in land compensation issues, and the builder Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) has told the authorities it will leave if the problems are not sorted out within two months. The Nepal government has acquired 119 bighas for IRCON subsidiary IRCON International to lay the track. The project is part of the Indian plan to build electric broad-gauge lines connecting five major industrial areas in Nepal to its rail network. Passenger and freight trains will run on the railway. Freight trains will bring raw materials to the factories and transport their finished goods to market. The Indian portion of the railway track which is 5 km long was completed three years ago. Work on the 13.6-km section in Nepal has stopped for months following disagreements over land compensation. Jiban Ghimire, Province 1 lawmaker and former minister for social development, on Tuesday drew the attention of the Provincial Assembly to the stalled project. Ghimire has requested the assembly members to take the issue seriously. The railway line was originally slated to be completed in October 2016. Construction work on the Indian side was completed on schedule. On the Nepal side, work came to a standstill because of disagreements with landowners over compensation. Aman Chitrakar, spokesperson for the Department of Railways, said IRCON had raised concern over the delay. He added that the local administration should mobilise security to resume work. According to Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general of the department, the compensation disputes are related to a 2-km stretch of the Biratnagar-Bathnaha railway line.

There are still disagreements on some stretches. Work cannot be resumed  mobilising the police because the case is sub judice. We cannot impose force. We have to wait for the court’s verdict,"" he said. Officials say they are not sure about the verdict coming any time soon.",1

200,Yarsa yields boost due to overharvesting, Himalayan News Service,"The testing of the irrigation canal began on Monday. Yarsagumba picking season falls in May and June, right before the monsoon starts, at elevations between around 3,000 and 5,000 metres above the sea level in various mountain districts of Nepal. According to locals and regular yarsagumba pickers, overharvesting and an increase in the number of collectors are the main reasons behind the dwindling collection of yarsagumba. They say the yarsagumba yield has decreased in the Api Himal area and other highlands in Darchula district. “The villagers started returning home as they could not find yarsagumba in the highlands. Yarsagumba could go extinct one day if there is no regulation on the amount of collection done every year,” said Nayan Singh Dhami, a resident of Api Himal Rural Municipality-1. “The government gives permits to a large number of pickers to go to the highlands and people without a permit also join them, leading to overcrowding and overharvesting. The authorities are only focussed on collecting tax and do not care about the impact of overharvesting in the highlands.” Nayan Singh, who ascended to the highlands a few weeks ago, returned home disappointed for his arduous highland sojourn did not bear good results. “The villagers who used to earn a good amount of money  collecting yarsa are disappointed. Many of us returned home with heavy hearts since our collection was very low,” said Nayan Singh. “The authorities allowed people from outside the district to go to the highlands to harvest the precious fungus. This led to overcrowding in the highlands and no one got a good share.” The collection of yarsagumba is a major income source for the people of Darchula, a mountain district of Sudurpaschim Province. The decreasing yield of the precious medicinal fungus this year has worried the local residents. Yarsagumba, which is found in the Himalayan region, is formed as a parasitic fungus that grows within a variety of caterpillars. It kills the caterpillar and emerges from its body as a thin stem.",1

246,50-50 chance of split in JSP: Ashok Rai, RAJU UPRETI,"Senior Leader of Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Ashok Rai has stated that the three top leaders should take responsibility for the internal dispute in the party.

JSP is on verge of yet another split due to differences between Chairman Upenda Yadav and Federal Council Chairman Baburam Bhattarai with the latter starting efforts to unchair Yadav.

JSP, formed after unification of the then Federal Socialist Party and Rastriya Janata Party (RJP), has already suffered a split after most of those coming from RJP left the party to register Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP).

The Bhattarai faction is actively trying to unseat Yadav accusing him of running the party unilaterally but Rai has conceded that all three top leaders including himself, Yadav and Bhattarai should take responsibility for the dispute.

“Talking about the context of Yadav running the party unilaterally, a three-member headquarter has been formed. Bhattarai, Yadav and myself are equally responsible if we say that headquarter didn’t work. Let us three hand over leadership to the new generation if it is so,” Rai has argued in a video interview with Setopati. “The headquarter has to work when the central executive committee does not meet. The headquarter meeting has not been convened. No one can get away saying Yadav acted arbitrarily.”

He has revealed that Yadav does not seem ready to make another chairman in accordance to the party statute while Bhattarai is not ready to adopt the policy of one person one post.

“Yadav has not been ready to make another chairman. We are currently in an under-construction party. We must opt for agreement if all the provisions of statute are not implemented in such state,” he reasons. “There will be split in party if we talk about majority and minority. Implementing the statute to the letter means adopting the policy of one person one post but Bhattarai and others do not agree.”

He has stressed that leaders have to work together on hundreds of issues even if they differ on one and added that forgetting 99 issues due to one is unfortunate. He has claimed that he believes that the party should be united for the people’s movement and is trying to create an environment for unity.

“There is 50-50 chance of the efforts succeeding. We may succeed or fail but should keep on trying,” he adds. “What has been reported in the media is more than the actual disputes in our party. There are debates and clashes between leaders. The disputes do not escalate toward split if that is tackled in a systematic manner.”

He has stressed that the ruling coalition will ally even in the upcoming elections and ruled out any chances of him returning to CPN-UML.",0

The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched. A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared  more than 4,500 people. The post reads as follows:  “Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused  the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in their surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”",1
348,"Vaccine acceptance is high, but many aren’t taking booster shots", THT Online,"On Monday, Deepak Bhurtel, a local from Ward 15 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, accompanied his daughter Sambhabi to her school, Siddhartha Vanasthali Institute, where the vaccine against Covid-19 was being administered to children aged five to 11 years. Sambhavi, a second grader, is seven years old. The school administration took the signature of Bhurtel and other parents as the consent to administer the vaccine, a regular process, to their children and asked parents to accompany their children at the time of vaccination. “All eligible members of my family have already been vaccinated against Covid,” said Bhurtel. “Today my daughter also got jabbed.” Bhurtel seemed pretty confident about the vaccine. “I think this vaccine will give a level of protection to my child.” There may have been some concerns from a handful of people, but most eligible Nepalis seem to have visited vaccine centres to get jabbed against Covid-19, and during the campaign for vaccinating children, the response was  and large overwhelming. It was also evident from the fact that the districts where the first phase of the campaign to vaccinate children aged between 5 and 11 was conducted ran out of doses. A multi-national study carried out in Nepal  the Centre for the Study of Labour and Mobility in collaboration with the US-based Yale University after the coronavirus pandemic shows that Covid-19 vaccine acceptance rate in Nepal is the highest in the world. The study shows that 97 percent of the Nepali population that is eligible for vaccines is ready to take the jabs. Not only the Covid-19 vaccination, when it comes to health programmes, acceptance rate of most of them is very high in Nepal. But when it comes to booster shots against Covid-19, Nepalis seem to have paid little attention.",1
349,Power utility calls off bid to sell 200MW to India under long-term contract, THT Online,"The Nepal Electricity Authority has scrapped its plan to sell 200MW of electricity to India under a long-term power purchase agreement. Citing legal complications after one of the bidders quoted “unsatisfactory” prices, the state-owned power utility was mulling over abandoning its plan to sell electricity under a five-month-long power purchase agreement (PPA). In early May, the NEA had invited bids from Indian companies to sell a total of 200MW for five months. As per the plan, it would sell electricity from July 1 to November 29, as part of a strategy to diversify risks because of volatile prices in the Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX), an electronic power trading platform. The entire bidding process has been scrapped now. The power utility has published a notice to this effect on its website. The bidders are requested to submit their official letters for the return of the respective Earnest Money Deposits (EMD), reads the notice published on June 27. “It is certain that we will not sell electricity under that earlier agreement,” said Kul Man Ghising, managing director of the NEA. “While the bids received were legally conflicting, we are already getting higher prices for our electricity in the IEX, so we reached a conclusion to drop the entire plan of selling power under the five-month-long plan.” The move comes just days ahead of the NEA’s plan to start selling power to India under a long-term agreement. The Post reported earlier this month that the power utility was in a fix over selling electricity after one of the Indian companies made two separate bids. Manikaran Power Limited quoted INR4.86 (Rs7.77) per unit for 100MW, the highest rate offered  any bidder, and INR3.68 (Rs5.88) per unit, for another 100MW, the fifth highest among the total of six bids received.",0
350,"Bhattarai, Yadav set to part ways 3 years after union as discord reaches tipping point", THT Online,"Baburam Bhattrarai and Upendra Yadav were fundamentally different—they were like chalk and cheese. But three years ago in May, they came up with a decision to merge their parties, after a failed attempt some two years before. They thought they could manage to get along. Bhattarai was leading the Naya Shakti Party Nepal, which was just three years old. Yadav, who had led various parties with different names, was the chair of the Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum-Nepal. They announced Samajbadi Party Nepal. Their goal: building a national level political force that could become an alternative to traditional communist parties and the Nepali Congress. The attempt has failed. A divorce between Bhattarai, the federal council chair of the party, and Yadav, the central chair, is not a matter of if but when, with the former already conveying a message that the two should part ways amicably so as to avoid public mud-slinging. “With Yadav calling a meeting of the central committee without consulting other leaders, I don’t think the party will have the same old central committee now,” said a leader close to Bhattarai. “We will have our own central committee meeting.” The current Janata Samajbadi Party was formed in April 2020 after the Bhattarai-Yadav-led Samajbadi Party Nepal merged with the Rastriya Janata Party. It, however, split in August last year. The Janata Samajbadi Party was awarded to Yadav and Bhattarai  the Election Commission, following which Mahantha Thakur formed the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. Insiders say it may take some time before the Janata Samajbadi split is announced.",0
351,"Despite six-decade history, parliamentary practice remains weak in Nepal", THT Online,"India’s parliamentary democracy had turned hardly seven when Nepal adopted it. However, Nepal’s parliamentary culture is still immature. Different ups and downs Nepal’s politics went through are responsible for the weakened parliamentary practice. However, more than that, the failure of the political and parliamentary leadership to strengthen the parliamentary systems is responsible for it, observers say. In less than a year and a half since the parliament commenced, King Mahendra on December 15, 1960 dissolved the House, arrested first elected prime minister BP Koirala and imposed the party-less Panchayat rule. It continued for 30 years. Although there was a parliament named Rastriya Panchayat, mostly those who were close to the palace got elected or nominated to it. However, even if the 30 years of Panchayat regime is discounted, the country’s parliamentary history is more than three decades old. Observers say strengthening parliament is part of state building but this never became the priority of the political leadership. “Every party tried to limit the role of parliament to make and unmake governments,” former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. “Not just parliament, all state organs haven’t functioned effectively because no attempts were ever made to strengthen the state institutions.” Dhungana, who became the first Speaker after the restoration of democracy in 1990, says when profit making becomes the sole objective of the political leadership and parties fail to inculcate idealism, state institutions are bound to remain weak. Despite six decades long history, the lawmaking process, which is the main function of parliament, is not participatory. Largely there is a tendency among the ruling party lawmakers not to counter the bills or proposals presented  the government. Similarly, in several instances the House meetings have been deferred in the lack of a quorum for the commencement and many lawmakers including the top leaders seldom show up in parliament or parliamentary committees. The House committees are often criticised for not taking mature decisions, not doing proper study on the issues they take up and often being selective in raising questions to the executive.",0

In developing economies, 1.6 billion adults with an account made merchant payments only in cash—including 670 million in India.

583,Crisis-hit Sri Lanka just days from running out of fuel,NepalNews,"Sri Lanka expects to run out of fuel in days, prompting the government to close schools in Colombo and order government employees to work from home, while troops handed tokens to people lining up for petrol to keep their places in the queue. Sri Lanka is suffering its worst economic crisis in seven decades, with foreign exchange reserves at a record low and the island of 22 million struggling to pay for essential imports of food, medicine and, most critically, fuel. Industries like garments, a big dollar earner in the Indian Ocean nation, are left with fuel for only about a week to 10 days. Public transport, power generation and medical services will get priority in fuel distribution, with some rationed to ports and airports. ""I have been in line for four days, I haven't slept or eaten properly during this time,"" said autorickshaw driver W.D. Shelton, 67, one of those who received a token meant to hold his place in the queue for when fuel becomes available. ""We can't earn, we can't feed our families,"" added Shelton, who was 24th in line at a fuel station in the centre of Colombo, but set to stay there as he had no petrol for the journey to his home just 5 km (3 miles) away. The government is talks with the IMF on a possible bailout, but many people can't wait that long. The navy in the early hours of Monday arrested 54 people off the eastern coast as they tried to leave  boat, a spokesman said, on top of 35 ""boat people"" held last week. Embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's elder brother resigned as prime minister last month after clashes between pro- and anti-government protesters spiralled into countrywide violence that left nine dead and about 300 people injured. An escalation of the fuel shortage could lead to a fresh wave of demonstrations. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa called for the government to step down. ""The country has collapsed completely due to the fuel shortage,"" he said in a video statement. ""The government has lied to the people repeatedly and has no plan on how to move forward.""POWER CUTS The government fuel stockpile stands at about 9,000 tonnes of diesel and 6,000 tonnes of petrol, the power minister said on Sunday, but no fresh shipments are due. Lanka IOC LIOC.CM, the local unit of Indian Oil Corporation IOC.NS, told Reuters it had 22,000 tonnes of diesel and 7,500 tonnes of petrol, and was expecting another 30,000 tonnes shipment of petrol and diesel combined around July 13. Sri Lanka consumes about 5,000 tonnes of diesel and 3,000 tonnes of petrol a day just to meet its transport requirements, Lanka IOC chief Manoj Gupta told Reuters. Other big consumers are industries like apparel and textiles companies, whose exports jumped 30% to $482.7 million in May, according to data released on Monday. ""We have enough fuel for the next seven to ten days, so we are managing,"" said Yohan Lawrence, secretary general of the Sri Lanka Joint Apparel Associations Forum. ""We are watching and waiting to see if fresh fuel stocks arrive and what will happen in the coming days."" Sri Lanka's power regulator said the country was using its last stocks of furnace oil to run multiple thermal power plants and keep power cuts to a minimum. Scheduled power cuts will rise to three hours from Monday from two and a half hours earlier. ""We are hoping to keep power cuts at three to four hours for the next two months,"" said Janaka Ratnayake, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. ""But given the situation of the country this could change."" FINANCIAL HELP The government has told employees to work from home until further notice, while schools have been shut for a week in the commercial capital of Colombo and surrounding areas. Fuel station queues have grown rapidly since last week. A team from the International Monetary Fund is visiting Sri Lanka for talks on a $3 billion bailout package.

592,3GPP officially completes specification of the upper 6GHz licensed band for 5G,Onlinekhabar,"At the 3GPP RAN#96 plenary meeting held from June 6 to 9, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) completed the standardization work of the upper 6 GHz spectrum (U6G, 6425–7125 MHz) as an IMT licensed band for NR, numbered n104, as part of Release 17.3GPP approved the RF specifications of this band for both network and user equipment, to provide a standard basis for the industry chain to develop products for this spectrum.At this meeting, a resolution was also introduced regarding the continuation of the on-going efforts to also specify the entire 6 GHz band (5925–7125 MHz) for IMT as part of Release 18. This marks a major milestone in making the entire 6 GHz band an IMT licensed band. The mobile industry is the engine of digital transformation, fueled  mid-band spectrum such as 6 GHz.Mobile communications have become an important pillar for countries to implement their national growth strategies, and sustainable development of the mobile industry is key to national digital transformation.The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) has been urging countries to release at least 2 GHz of mid-band spectrum  2025 to 2030 to realize the vision for 5G data rates proposed  the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).Ranging from 5925 MHz to 7125 MHz, the 6 GHz band is a crucial part of mid-band spectrum.Providing the advantages of low bands in coverage and high bands in capacity, it enables operators to provide ubiquitous 5G high-bandwidth services at a low per-bit cost, promoting continuous innovation of emerging 5G services and accelerating digital transformation in society.Global efforts across the mobile industry accelerate the standardization process and ecosystem development of 6 GHz.Half a year after being initiated  the 3GPP at a RAN plenary meeting on December 17, 2021, the standardization of U6G as a new IMT licensed band was completed. This is attributed to the joint efforts of global operators, equipment vendors, device and chipset vendors, and other industry partners.It also shows the mobile industry's resolve to quickly promote U6G as an IMT licensed band.The RF specifications standardized for U6G will promote the industry chain to develop the mobile networks, devices, and ecosystem. Currently, field tests on 6 GHz IMT are well underway, paving the way to implement 6 GHz IMT's pre-commercial deployment  2025.WRC-23 is a cannot-miss stage for 6 GHz to rise as a global IMT band.The next World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) will be held in 2023, and provides a golden opportunity for governments to coordinate 6 GHz strategies and discuss how to develop the telecom ecosystem globally.The mobile industry has reached a primary consensus on how U6G will serve IMT. At WRC-19, a resolution was made to designate AI 1.2 to U6G IMT in WRC-23.#3GPP #6g #5g",0

It means the government needs to spend over Rs 15 billion daily  mid-July to reach the set target.

But as the flow of oxygen, which is at a stretch to accommodate more than double the capacity here, has dropped, it's hard to save critical patients,"" said a health worker, adding that most of the infected patients who died were in critical condition.Given the low flow of oxygen, even those who could be saved are dying, and the problem is so severe that the oxygen system is on the verge of collapse, he further said.Compared to Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital, Bheri Hospital has a high rate of deaths every day. Health workers have gathered that the higher death rate at Bheri Hospital has to do with the low oxygen flow.The hospital's medical superintendent Dr Prakash Thapa said the hospital, faced with high pressure of patients requiring oxygen, is exploring ways to economise on oxygen use. Oxygen can't be given to all critical patients with the present infrastructure we have, he said.Anaesthesiologist Dr Parash Pande also spoke about the hard time the hospital was facing. ""As we can't provide oxygen to all patients through the existing supply system, patients are being given oxygen from the cylinder itself. But as the oxygen flow has reduced due to the high number of patients, it's difficult to save critical patients who require more oxygen,"" Pande said.Some 400 to 450 cylinders of oxygen is being used at the hospital every day. Though the hospital has purchased and brought a liquid oxygen tank, it hasn't been able to install it so far.",0

680,Free eye camp benefits more than 500 people,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Thirteen-year-old Abhishek Phombo of Aathrai Rural Municipality in Tehrathum lost his eyesight when he was just four. He was suffering from cataract, an eye ailment commonly found among old people.Phombo’s happiness knew no bounds when he underwent a surgery during an eye camp organised in Phidim, the district headquarters of Panchthar, in March second week. He got his eyesight back after nine years.“I was very worried thinking that I would have to spend my whole life in darkness. The doctors and health workers at the eye camp gave me light. I am very happy and grateful to them,” he said.Like Abhishek, many children in the country’s eastern hill districts are suffering from cataract, a condition in which the lens of the eye gradually becomes opaque resulting in blurry vision and eventually blindness. According to ophthalmologists, cataracts usually affect the ageing and elderly population. However, cases of cataract among children and newborns are rising of late.As many as 218 people underwent eye surgery in the health camp organised jointly  Phidim Municipality, Janasewa Samaj Panchthar and Mechi Eye Hospital. Among them, 12 patients were below 16 years of age and most of them were suffering from cataract. According to the organisers, 20 other eye patients who underwent surgery were in the 17-40 age group.“The disease is very common among people above 40 years of age. But the number of children and youths suffering from cataract is increasing in recent years,” said Dr Kabita Karki Kaderiya, an ophthalmologist at Mechi Eye Hospital. According to her, cataract is taking its toll among children mainly due to carelessness in eye treatment and injuries. Some of the children might even be born with cataracts, she added.Many people in remote areas continue to suffer from various eye ailments due to a lack of access to health institutions for regular eye check-ups. The villagers greatly benefit from free health camps like the one recently organised in Phidim.Dhan Bahadur Tamang, 80, of Hilihang Rural Municipality-7 in Panchthar also received treatment at the eye camp in Phidim. He regained his eyesight after eight years.“Doctors are like gods. I can see people and things around me after the doctors cured my eyes,” said Tamang.According to ophthalmologists, a lack of regular eye check-up, air pollution and long hours on computer screens and cell phones are the leading causes of eye problems these days. They warn people not to take any eye problem lightly and urge them to visit health institutions for timely treatment.

681,Balen Chasma-Balen Coat-Balen Daari: The craze is not ruling Capital's streets now,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Nepali youth tend to easily ignore politics and public affairs showing zero or no interest in it. However, Balendra Shah popularly known as Balen Shah, the independent mayoral candidate of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), has managed to catch the attention of not just the politically-interested few, but young and old alike. For the youth, the wellgroomed Shah has become immensely popular not just for his candidacy, but also for his unique style statement.As Shah has been leading the mayoral race since the first day of the counting of votes, the youngsters' interest in this structural engineer, rapper and music composer has also been increasing - they admire not only his mayoral vision, fans and followers have started imitating his sartorial aesthetics as well as the way he keeps his beard. A bearded Shah sporting a pair of dark glasses smartly turned out in a coat with the flag of Nepal draped over his shoulders has given birth to the hordes of admirers.One such admirer is 27-year-old Avinam Thapa from Baneshwore who calls Shah's style ""unique"".""I like his signature look - the classic coat and the spectacles - I have a pair of glasses that are kind of similar to his, but they are not exactly the same,"" shared Thapa, a student.Shah usually dons a pair of narrow, rectangular shades and his style has impressed 28-year-old teacher from Sinamangal, Bivatsu Neupane.He is in love with Shah's fashion, but amongst all ""it's the kalo chasma (shades) that suits him the best"".The craze for Shah's shades is such that they are being sold as 'Balen Chasma', both online and in the market. One can find a number of online stores promoting the shades with lines such as: 'Balen dai ko chasma yaha pahinchha', 'Trending eyeglasses of Balen Shah now available with us... stock limited', and so on.Equally prepared are the owners of physical stores.Take for instance Bishnu Kumar Shrestha, owner of Be Smart, an optical store in Kathmandu Mall.""Balen Shah is a huge craze at present,"" he said referring to the large number of customers of the new generation visiting his store in search of 'Balen Chasma'.""Balen dai ko chasma dekhaunusna (please show us the shades of Balen dai,"" is one line that he has been hearing regularly in the last few days from customers and he has managed to sell around 150 pairs of the said shades in this time span.Thirty-eight-year old Subash Dhital, who hails from Kavre and is currently residing in Kathmandu, is one such ardent fan of 'Balen Chasma'; he bought a pair from Bishal Bazar a couple of days ago.Showcasing his pair of golden black shades, Dhital, a farmer  profession revealed that he is a fan of Shah's shades, coat and vision.""I am impressed  his looks and personality. Balen Shah is a very polite and soft-spoken person who talks rationally. I have full faith in him and his vision as the mayoral candidate,"" Dhital expressed.Thanks to fans like him, there has been a surge of demand for such glasses, informed Shrestha who revealed that this is not a new product in the market though. They already existed in the market earlier but got popular with Shah's soaring popularity.Shrestha also informed that these kind of shades fit well on small and oval faces which is mostly suitable for the faces of Nepalis - this could also be the reason that people are more interested in them.Like men, women too are enthusiastic about the 'Balen Chasma', though they are comparatively less in number as compared to male customers, informed Shrestha, who sells a pair of such glasses for Rs 1,100.Aarohi Basnet, 21, is one such female who is a fan of 'Balen Chasma'. The Bhaktapur resident called Shah's style ""inspiring and classic"" as she revealed, ""I like his shades and I am thinking of buying a pair like his.""At Shrestha's store, the shades are available in golden and brown glasses with frames in golden, brown, silver, and black colours.""Customers, however, mostly prefer golden black shades, as Balen Shah is more frequently using these colours,"" shared Shrestha as he also admitted that Shah has a good sense of fashion.""People mostly admire his appearance - as a young person he has the alpha male personality.""While the shades are the most popular accessory worn  Shah, people are equally fond of his coat. Since filing his candidacy for the post of KMC mayor, Shah has been seen mostly in a coat in hues of maroon, navy blue, chequered grey, among others.And the stores are seeing a surge of demand for such coats in the Capital, as per Krishna Dhakal, owner of KB Store in Sundhara.""There has been a certain spike in the demand for the coats worn  Balen Shah in the last three days,"" he said as he revealed that people visit his store asking for ""Balen coat"".Along with imitating Shah, people are also liking this coat as it is a ""forever coat that can be worn in any season"", as per Dhakal.It is mostly the youngsters who are buying the 'Balen coat', but it is popular amongst men of all ages, he added while revealing that the coat in ""navy blue"" has a high demand.As Dhakal revealed the market trend, he also shared his impression of Shah: ""I think he (Balen Shah) intentionally wears navy blue coat and golden black spectacles more so that he can be recognised  his look. As an independent mayoral candidate, he wants to make his signature style so as to stand out in the crowd.His craze has just started. But if he keeps his promises and does what he says after winning the mayoral position, his fashion style will be even more popular. People in the Valley have recently begun to adopt his fashion style - particularly his coat and glasses. But over time, people throughout Nepal will adopt it - if he keeps on winning people's trust.""Dhakal also expressed his optimism towards Shah as ""he seems to be someone with new ideas, skills, and diplomacy.He is a professional engineer, and I believe he has a good understanding of infrastructure development and construction. I am optimistic that he will do good management of Kathmandu Valley"".Shah's beard is another popular thing amongst youngsters, as per Annand Thakur, a barber in Sundhara.""Young men with thick beards have requested that I give them the appearance of Balen Shah,"" he shared as he revealed that in the past youth used to want Kabir Singh-style beard followed  Yash-style beard inspired  KGF movie.""They are now requesting a Balen Shah-style beard. This is the first time I have found Nepali youth wanting to adopt the style of a Nepali idol,"" Thakur shared his observation.True to Thakur's claim, 22-year-old Saurav Oli, a student from Naikap ""loves Balen Shah's beard along with a desire to own a coat like him"".Meanwhile, 33-year-old Saroj Rai from Naikap compares Shah's fashion sense to Indian acting legend Rajinikanth - ""he is bold and classic with a great sense of fashion"".Twenty-four-year-old Deepak Budha Magar, a student who hails from Bardiya, admires the vision of Shah as the mayoral candidate as he compares him to Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor in Nayak movie - ""someone who is young and eager to help the City"".As the Balen Shah phenomenon sweeps through the Capital - be it in terms of his mayoral candidacy and the lead he is taking against seasoned politican Keshav Sthapit and another powerful candidate Srijana Singh among others or his fashion statement - people have been looking to him as a beacon of hope.A businessman from Chabahil, Suraj Gautam, 36, is one of them who said, ""The public expects candidates like him who are truthful and young and want to do something for the common people.""Probably this could be the reason people are in love with his fashion sense too, he interprets.

The goods loaded  vehicles coming in and going out at the customs point need not be manually checked with the installation of vehicle scanner system. The minister also urged customs employees to increase revenue collection  maintaining honesty in the classification and evaluation of goods.Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini urged the customs administration to work as per the principle of improvement, facilitation and good governance. He directed customs staff to immediately stop the practice of entertaining phone calls from any party, leader or trade union or organisation that exert pressure seeking transfer. ""The employee adopting such measures for getting a transfer has already compromised on his/her integrity.You can understand yourself the job performance of such a person,"" he said.Revenue secretary Krishna Hari Pushkar directed employees to carry out works in such a way that the service seeker has no room for complaint.He stressed that works should be done so that the grievances of service-recipients are promptly addressed.Senior Vice-president of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Chandra Dhakal thanked the government for bringing the policy through the replacement bill for protecting and promoting domestic industries.

686,Pandemic and shutdowns leave students with succour,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Santosh Kafle,16, has lately been spending his days either playing video games on his mother's cell phone, watching TV serials or video chatting with his friends on social media. The tenth grader from the Valley has been busy with these sorts of activities ever since the prohibitory orders were put in place in the Valley, amidst the pandemic.However, Kafle said that he has been resorting to the aforementioned activities ""as an escape from the monotony caused  the long boring day inside my room and the unproductive online classes which don't cater to my needs as a quiet student"". He finds the online classes unproductive as he does not get the confidence to interact with his teachers. ""I feel shy to ask questions online which wasn't the case in physical classes,"" he admitted.However, he is feeling relieved these days as his online classes ""formally stopped around a week ago after the government decided to publish the results of our Secondary Education Examination (SEE) based on internal evaluation from our school"".According to Deepak Sharma, Spokesperson at the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Cabinet meeting decided not to conduct physical examination for SEE this year. It decided to conduct SEE through internal evaluation from the respective schools.Though a decision has been made regarding the SEE, students pursuing other levels of education are having a hard time due to the uncertainty regarding their examinations.And many students like Kafle are facing problems regarding online classes and are worried as exams are not taking place on time since the education sector has been adversely affected due to the pandemic.""I studied on my own during last year's lockdown so that I could make up for the loss in studies due to lack of physical classes.However, the recent postponement of my exams due to the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic has made me wary about my overall education and career,"" shared Keshav Bastola, 25, a Bachelor's level student of Humanities and Social Sciences at Tribhuvan University (TU).On a positive note Bastola shared that he ""will fight against all odds and make the most of the free time during the prohibitory orders  studying harder for my exams"".However, Sushma Aryal, 24, who is pursuing her MBBS degree at Chitwan Medical College (CMC), Bharatpur feels that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has ""seriously hampered"" her studies.""I had to come back home here last year as my college was closed indefinitely due to the pandemic. I had been able to return to Chitwan to pursue my studies just two months ago with the pandemic under control.However, I am back in the Valley again as the new wave of the virus has again closed my college,"" Aryal shared.According to her, she is finding it very difficult to understand the subject matters taught in the online classes conducted  her college ""owing to technical disturbances as well as lack of free communication - as compared to online classes we used to communicate with teachers more freely in physical classes"".Hence, Aryal, a final year student, has been feeling ""anxious"" as she questioned, ""How can I score well in exams and become a good doctor in the future if I don't understand my subjects properly?""The pandemic has also hit many students planning to pursue their higher studies abroad due to travel restrictions.Deepak Silwal,19, who had scored ""a 7.5 in IELTS and was already in the final process of applying at a few prospective universities in Australia for scholarship"" now feels ""uncertain"" about his higher studies plans abroad.""Firstly, all my excitement of scoring well in IELTS has faded away since I can't go to Australia any sooner due to the travel restrictions.Secondly, the uncertain nature of the pandemic coupled with new virus variants popping up in the country and abroad has made me feel safer to stay back home rather than going abroad with uncertainties.""Silwal, a science student seems to be at crossroads between fulfilling his dream of studying abroad and the reality of the circumstances, as he said, ""Now I have been waiting desperately for the prohibitory orders to be lifted soon to make a wise decision regarding where I should be studying.""Equally concerned are parents who believe the current crisis will have a lasting impact on their children.One such parent is Anjan Pahadi, 54, a daily wage worker from Dhumbarahi, who has lately been ""very worried"" about his eighth-grade daughter's studies.Pahadi shared, ""My daughter had always come first with excellent grades in all the different schools she studied at. However, she has been feeling very lethargic and uninterested in studies ever since last year's lockdown and it's very disappointing for me since she is the only one who is educated in my entire family and we all have high hopes from her.""Pahadi also doubts the quality of education ""under the current circumstances when schools themselves evaluate students without taking physical exams"".He questioned, ""What good can such cheap certificates bring to our children in their career? I have managed for my daughter's studies  working my fingers to the bone, but will she now be able to make good use of my sacrifices?""However, Ghanashyam Wagle, a retired Professor of Education at TU said, ""Since the whole country, including the education sector, has been suffering from the pandemic, students should not be frustrated and take it personally. Also, since many students don't have Internet access, they should be ready to adapt to the changed circumstances and make the best use of either the primary or secondary sources related to their studies that they have access to.""He said that ""since students are the future of the country, the government should try its best to make sure no student gets deprived of their fair share of basic education even in times of crisis like these.",1
687,The Clubhouse is peace,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Clubhouse has become the talk of the town of late. It's an audio-based invite-only social media application that allows users to create or join voice chat rooms conveniently.It has been around since March 2020 when it was launched  Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Paul Davidson and Rohan Seth, according to The Guardian. In May 2020, it had just 1,500 users. However, its popularity has increased a lot within a little more than a year - as of June 6, it has 10 million plus users worldwide, and a lot of them are from Nepal. In the case of Nepal, the audio-based platform seems quite popular among teenagers as well as young adults that include professionals from different walks of life. Prashank Sapkota, 28, entrepreneur and Chartered Accountant from Dhumbarahi, has been using Clubhouse regularly ""since I downloaded the app on my phone two weeks ago"".Sapkota said he came to know about the app through ""Facebook groups and friends who sent me an invite to join their rooms"".Sharing his experience with the app, Sapkota said, ""As a professional, I am finding the app very helpful as it offers lots of information on diverse topics through the audio discussions held in multiple chat rooms. I can easily jump in and out of chat rooms without having to notify anyone."" He also shared, ""My friends involved in different professions are using the app."" As Sapkota mentioned The Himalayan Times talked to several individuals across the country and found out that most of them have been finding the use of Clubhouse beneficial for them and it's mostly through 'word of mouth' that they came to know about the app.So, why is the app so popular in the country? Sharing his views Anup Timilsina, 19, a Plus-two student in the Valley shared that it's mostly due to ""the initial curiosity about the app after coming to know through my friends that even Elon Musk and Bill Gates were already using it"".This led him and his ""group of classmates"" to download and use the app ""which we all are finding as a boon during the lockdown-like prohibitions."" For Timilsina, the multiple audio rooms with interesting group discussions on an array of topics ranging from ""sports, movies, music, business start-up ideas, among others are not only informative, they have also helped us be occupied during the prohibitory orders"".""If you feel bored, just turn on the app and you are fully absorbed in its amazing world,"" he added.The users are also finding the app a good way to connect with people (someone they know or strangers) and develop speaking and leadership skills.Sanjay Shrestha, 33, an NGO professional has only been using the app for ""some 10 days and has already found it very fruitful in developing my leadership skills as a speaker and programme host through the audio rooms"".Shrestha has been hosting several talk programmes on topics ranging from ""politics, gender, sexuality, international relationship, among others"" in the rooms he creates for ""friends and unknown guests"".""Since I have to constantly do a presentation at my job and communicate with people from diverse backgrounds, the rooms in the app have been working wonders for me in my profession and my confidence level has increased to some extent since I first started using the app,"" he added.For Srijana Parajuli, 24, a regular social media user, the app has been the ""answer to my long wait for something new as it had been quite monotonous only using the regular social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, among others"".Though other apps have interactive options like texting or commenting on others' posts or photos, they do not bring people together, she feels. ""However, Clubhouse brings everyone closer through direct talks,"" she opined.Parajuli also finds ""talk rooms more authentic than Facebook posts"" as she believes such posts can be misleading in many instances, and there is no one to fact check it. She added, ""However, there is less chance for such misleading information to spread via Clubhouse as the sessions are live and the speakers have to be very sure of what they are saying. Any misleading idea will be contested  the listeners present there. In case of any doubt, one can instantly ask questions and clarify the doubts.""According to Parajuli, she has so far not hosted her own room but has regularly participated in ""others' chat rooms especially in Chia Guff - a popular local chat room in the app"" which she says is ""a good way to start your day through casual conversation about your interests"".Pritam Siwakoti, 23, a Bachelor's level student from Chitwan however has been using the app for an interesting purpose - she is searching for a boyfriend with similar interests in the chat rooms of the Clubhouse ""that allows us open up about our love life and problems we are facing"".Siwakoti, who ""has remained single after breaking up with her boyfriend some one year back"" said, ""I have been desperately wanting to be in a relationship with someone with matching interests for a lasting relationship.""""So far I have already chatted with a couple of like-minded guys in audio rooms and a guy has followed me on Instagram. We are already chatting on Facebook as well. It has been possible through this amazing app,"" she shared.Siwakoti however shared that she has been ""actively using other social media platforms as usual since all the other apps have their own unique features which can't be ignored"".Ranju Silwal, 26, an employee at a financial cooperative in the Valley, who has been using Clubhouse ""for a week now"" finds it ""much better than Zoom and Google Meet"".She said, ""Zoom and Google Meet only allow fixed persons in their meetings whereas Clubhouse welcomes everyone interested in its rooms. Similarly, you mostly need permissions to enter the meetings in Zoom and Google Meet which is not the case with Clubhouse.""According to Silwal, since Clubhouse is only audio-based, ""its sound quality is much better than the aforementioned apps and I feel a better connection through it compared to other modes of communication.""Silwal also shared that she feels comfortable to talk in Clubhouse as compared to ""the virtual meetings in other apps which are more formal"".Although many are already reaping the benefits  using Clubhouse, not all are fans of the new app. ""I feel at ease just chatting with someone through texts as I am not so fond of long talks. I also can't post opinions or watch videos on Clubhouse, so I find it monotonous just listening to people continuously,"" shared Sudip Basnet, 26, from the Valley.He also shared that he ""finds the talks slow-paced since you have to wait until the other guys finish talking. You also can't see or upload photos or interesting comments on the platform.""However, Anuj Gupta, 35, a computer engineer and IT professional in the Valley, has different facts to share.Gupta who has been using the app ""for three weeks now"" shared ""Clubhouse is getting very popular among Nepali teens since they can use it only after getting an invite from friends - which means they are getting curious about it. Also, as most of the people in the country use Android phones, the downloads of app have increased rapidly after its recent availability on Android phones. It was previously only launched on Apple phones.""The US-based social media app was first introduced to iOS, and then launched for Android in May this year.The other reason for its popularity according to Gupta is because it maintains users' privacy ""as the conversations won't be recorded and vanishes from the app soon after the meeting is over"".Gupta shared that ""since your face is not seen during the talk, even introverts can talk easily without feeling shy. This could also gradually turn you into an extrovert  giving you a platform to express yourself freely"".",1
688,Restrictions add to the plight of out of Valley's street animals,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Words fail to describe the pitiful condition faced  street dogs in the Valley these days.They used to survive on scraps of waste food dumped on the roadsides or leftovers thrown in the neighbourhoods. However, with most of the Valley dwellers locked in their homes and no source of food available with the prohibitory orders in place, the creatures are finding it hard to survive,"" said Rukmini Tamang, 59, a resident of Jorpati.Tamang, however has been ""regularly feeding street dogs in my locality"" a mixture of ""rice, daal, and buff meat"" that she prepares ""every morning"".And she's been doing so on her own ever since the restrictions were imposed.However, she regards her feeding a bunch of street dogs as "" drop in the ocean"" as ""thousands of street dogs around the Valley are in desperate need of help"".Along with dogs, cows and oxen that roam the Valley roads are also currently facing difficult times. This is when animal welfare organisations like Sneha's Care step in to offer much-needed relief to street animals in the Valley.These days, Sneha Shrestha, 39, founder and owner of Sneha's Care, a Lalitpur-based non-profit charity, together with her staff is quite busy making the rounds of the Valley in two of her vehicles, feeding street animals at several locations.Each morning, Shrestha and her team of seven staff prepare a mixture of buff meat, pumpkin, and rice for dogs and boiled potatoes and grams for monkeys. They also take along vegetables like cabbage and grains for cows, and rice grains for birds ""to feed them on the way"".""We feed around 1,200 animals daily at places such as Haatiban, Khumaltar, Sanepa, Satdobato, Ekantakuna, Pulchowk, Jamal, Ratna Park, Exhibition Road, Sinamangal, Pashupati area, among other places. Organisations like us have fixed locations to feed animals so as not to overfeed at some places while animals remain underfed at other places,"" shared Shrestha.Shrestha also shared ""constant obstructions from the traffic police due to the travel restrictions in place and the COVID-19 fear among the staff have affected the process of feeding animals to an extent"".Shrestha who has already rehabilitated ""170 injured or diseased street animals from the Valley roads"" at her facility in Lalitpur shared that ""there are still thousands of injured and diseased animals lying on the roads and the government should work out long-term plans for building a good number of animal shelters in the country which can offer big relief to street animals"".Apart from animal welfare organisations, a few individuals are also extending help to street animals on their own. The Himalayan Times came across one such individual on the premises of Pashupati who was feeding biscuits to dogs and monkeys.Nitin Tiwari, 25, a resident of Gaushala comes ""to Pashupati every morning"" carrying a backpack filled with food of different sorts.""Since the temple is closed, visitors can't come around, which means all the local animals and birds are cut off from their main source of food. Hence, I have been bringing biscuits for the dogs and monkeys, vegetables for cows and oxen, and corn for the pigeons in the surrounding areas, which I believe will at least keep them going,"" shared Tiwari.He has been using his ""own money"" to feed the animals despite ""my family's insistence to not to go out due to the fear of COVID-19"".Tiwari believes that ""this is the perfect time to prove our worth as human beings  extending help to our fellow creatures during such hard times"".""This is what actually makes us human,"" he added.When it comes to addressing such a grave problem faced  the street animals, the government is the foremost authority everyone turns to. However, Dr Lok Nath Paudel, Chief Livestock Development Officer at the National Livestock Resource Management and Promotion Office under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development said, ""We don't have specific programmes to feed street animals. However, we have been playing the role of a coordinator between the local level authorities, animals welfare associations, and veterinary associations across the country and they have been feeding the street animals at the community levels.""Asked if the stray animals are being adopted  the department for their rehabilitation, Paudel dismissed it saying, ""The lack of infrastructure in the country has made it impossible to adopt street animals so far.""Similarly, Ishwor Man Dangol, Spokesperson at Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) said, ""We don't have any plan to feed street animals, but we are giving permission to animal welfare associations in the Valley to feed them.""Venting ire on the lackadaisical approach of the government towards solving these ever-present problems faced  street dogs in the Valley, Rajan Bhandari, 41, an animal rights activist from Sinamangal said, ""The government has decided to make the Valley roads beggar-free, but why are the authorities never talking about managing thousands of street dogs leading miserable lives on the Valley roads? It's a pity that the government didn't mull over providing even a small portion of the budget to offer relief to these street animals who have been suffering for more than a year due to the pandemic.""Bhandari added, ""The Valley dwellers are equally to be blamed for the street dogs' plights as they keep dogs as pets for the safety of their house and for their children's happiness and then later leave them on the roads when the dogs get diseased and old.""Hence, he requests everyone to ""either not keep dogs as pets at all or regard them as their own children if they wish to keep one"".The Himalayan Times was informed that the animals at the Central Zoo, Jawalakhel are being fed properly even during the ongoing crisis.Dr Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel, Project Manager at Central Zoo, shared, ""We have been providing food for our animals like in normal times and everything is fine so far.""",1
689,Masking up even when home to keep loved ones unsafe,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Since the past few days Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior consultant cardiologist at Nepal Cardiac Centre, has been sharing awareness videos accompanied  various studies and research evidences on why people should start wearing masks inside their homes as well, and refrain from inviting guests via his Facebook handle which has more than a million followers.His effort to make people aware has come at a time when Nepal is dealing with the deadlier, more infectious new wave of the pandemic, with hospitals across the country reeling under acute shortage of medical oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds in view of the rising number of infections. To know more in detail, THT spoke to Dr Anil, who has been actively researching and studying about the need of the aforementioned precaution, since May 2020.""Everyone should start wearing masks inside their homes as well to keep the coronavirus (COVID-19) at bay,'' informed Dr Anil.The reason behind this recommendation according to Dr Anil is that COVID-19 spreads primarily from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, which travel in the air when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, shout or sings. These droplets, which stay suspended in the air for at least three hours (as per The New England Journal of Medicine), can then land in the mouths or noses of people in the vicinity, or may be breathed in.And though infected ""a large group of population does not show symptoms.Thus, the asymptomatic people can continue to spread the infection at home, at a faster pace"" as per him.Giving an example he said, ""If an individual from a family is infected but has no symptoms, he while dining, talking, coughing, sneezing spreads large number of virus in the air. Theseviruses tend to float around and there's a high chance of its transmission to family members.""Dr Anil sees this as a reason why cases are rising in the nation. ""We are overlooking this fact and this is a less talked-about issue. In my view, there isn't a single family who has been wearing mask inside home. But everyone should start wearing it. That is why we have been seeing entire families, in this wave, testing positive, even when most of them have stayed indoors,"" he shared, while also revealing that his family has been wearing masks inside the home too.Dr Anil's recommendation aligns well with the various studies and researches conducted across the globe.A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COV- ID-19 case conducted from February 28 to March 27, 2020, in Beijing, China has stated that transmission of COV- ID-19 within families and close contacts accounts for the majority of epidemic growth.As per this study, accepted for publication in the British Medical Journal, indoor masking is 79 per cent effective in curbing transmission - but only before symptoms emerge.Meanwhile, wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea.Similarly, a new assessment published in The Lancet journal said there is consistent, strong evidence to prove that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, behind the COVID-19 pandemic, is predominantly transmitted through the air.Furthermore, a study of US Centres for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), shows the that there is a high level of benefit of indoor masking. The CDC stated that masks should still be worn in addition to staying at least six feet apart, especially when indoors around people who don't live in your household.Likewise, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Service too has stated that there is a negligible risk of transmission when there is a distance of six feet between two persons and when both of them are wearing masks.According to the data illustrated, the risk is 1.5 per cent (low) when both people are wearing masks, five per cent (medium) when only the infected person is wearing a mask and uninfected persons are unmasked, 30 per cent (high) if the infected person is not wearing a mask but the uninfected person is wearing one, and 90 per cent (highest) when neither the infected nor the uninfected person is wearing a mask.Appealing to everyone to stay safe and wear masks even inside their homes, Dr Anil said, ""It's high time we considered wearing mask inside homes too. It's better if you are staying at a well ventilated space as traces of virus would float out easily.""He added, ""Let's wear mask and keep our loved one safe and sound.",1
690,"tangling of life's mess, connecting through soul",Routine of Nepal Banda,"Each of the 32 colourful works of art  Sabita Dongol exhibited at the Siddhartha Art Gallery features decorative motifs, comb, couple and nature in a way that anyone can easily understand her art and also generate multiple meanings from a single piece of art, especially regarding love, nature, world and peace. Also all the images in the artwork are interconnected to each other.The works are on display at the exhibition titled 'Inclination of Souls 'that began on April 12. For instant, the colourful motif of one man and woman with one heart in the work titled 'Complimentary thoughts and emotions' shows that the two are inseparable beings.The decorative red background seems to convey the thought that the couple is interconnected too through their soul.Dongol also has presented an image of Yin-Yang behind the couple's head in the same art just like Buddha's enlightenment seeming to say that man and woman are complimentary to each other. Similarly, the couple is secured in a blue coloured circle as if they are standing on earth.One can even find religious and cultural aspects in the same piece.The artist has painted motifs of many religious shrines like mosques, temples, gumbas with Buddha's flag and even antique residential house.Dongol has drawn the woman's dress in such a way that the bottom part of the dress is in the shape of a comb symbolising peace and harmony maintained after untangling life's difficulties just like a comb untangles tangled curls of hair.The artist has also created six artworks in mixed media using acrylic pen, colourful ink, watercolour, paper.There is also a separate set of wooden combs in her Astamangala series. Altogether nine combs of different sizes and colours have been hung on the second floor of the gallery.Regarding this series, Dongol shared, ""I mostly use a comb as a central motif in my paintings. Comb untangles tangled hair. Astamangala also resolves the problems of our life in the same way. This is why I have been using a comb as a symbol that solves problems and brings harmony to various entities.""Dongol also reasoned the colours she has applied in her works represent her innermost thoughts and ideas. ""Different colours suggest different experiences I have gone through. Through all these colours and forms I feel I am heading toward a very peaceful space."" She also shared her happiness at being able to exhibit her work of five years.""Every artist dreams of holding a solo exhibition in this gallery. My dream has come true with this exhibition.It's my sixth solo exhibition but the first one in this gallery,"" Inaugurating the exhibition, KK Karmacharya, Chancellor of Nepal Academy of Fine Arts shared, ""I found the colours used  Dongol very charming. The message she wants to convey is also very powerful.One needs to study many things to create art. Dongol's hard work is reflected in the artworks on display.""The exhibition is on till April 29.",1
691,storing eyesight: From Doramba to the world,Routine of Nepal Banda,"Watching people dance, sing, laugh, even cry and hug their loved ones with joy after being able to see is a magical moment - and that is something you get to experience in every eye camp held  the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology (TIO).The most recent experience was aft the Doramba Outreach Micro Surgical Eye Clinic (OMEC) - the eye camp at Shree Kakling Secondary School in Doramba of Ramechhap - organised  the TIO from March 17 to 20. The magical moment at the camp, especially on March 19, was something to seal in one's memory forever as the emotional patients expressed their jubilance after being able to see. A day after their operation the patients were made to sit on the rows of benches on the school's ground, and Dr Sanduk Ruit started taking off their bandages one  one. They were all smiles, experiencing light again, identifying people in front of them, naming the colours they would see or count the fingers the doctor would ask them.Amongst them was 38-year old Krishna Bahadur Majhi, a diabetic patient since the past three years, who had lost sight in both his eyes nearly a year ago ""due to high blood sugar level"".A daily wage labourer from Sukute of Sindhupalchowk, Majhi had been dependent on his wife even for minor things. The Majhi couple was hopeful before the surgery that Krishna Bahadur would be able to see.""When I had gone to the eye screening camp in my area, they told me that Dr Ruit would operate on my eyes,"" shared Krishna Bahadur, who did not know about the doctor and was sceptical if he'd be able to see as he had already made rounds of different hospitals and spent ""around Rs 2.5 lakh that I had arranged as loan"" with no significant improvement.He was then told  someone to check a text book of Class X that has a biography of Dr Ruit.He shared this with his neighbours who checked the book, found about this eye surgeon and read it aloud to him.On March 18, the same doctor operated on both his eyes, and on March 19 he saw light again.As the doctor pulled the bandage off this diabetic patient, his expression was unexplainable.At first he just gazed at the doctor in front of him, and then was elated that he could see, and saw his wife, hugged her and expressed his happiness and gratefulness for being able to see the light of day again!Everyone present had moist eyes, felt overwhelmed as the young man promised: ""I will now take care of my wife"".Another touching moment was when Gyan Yonjan could not hold his tears upon seeing his 75-year-old mother Maichyang Tamang being able to see again with both her eyes. His mother had not been able to get cataract surgery of both eyes till then as she was unable to travel long distances.Every patient present at the camp for the surgery had a story to share like that of Majhi and Tamang. Ninety-year-old Putali Basyal's sister expected her life to be easier as Putali would not need a caretaker now onwards as she was able to see with both her eyes again. Plus the free treatment at the camp was a relief for the elderly who would otherwise not be able to afford the treatment.Meanwhile Min Bahadur Tamang, 76, now wishes to sleep inside his home, and not on the bed outside as he was confident, ""I will be able to go to toilet comfortably opening the door on my own at night now that I can see with both my eyes"".A total of 333 surgeries of cataract patients were done  Dr Ruit and his son Dr Sagar at the camp that saw nine cases of bilateral cataracts (cataracts in both eyes of a person), informed Pankaj Thapa, Communications Manager at Tej Kohli & Ruit Foundation.The surgery was worth watching - it looked very effortless and swift as the doctors made a tiny incision in the patients' eye, pulled out the cataract, and then inserted new lens in the eye. The next day as the bandage was pulled off, the patients were able to see the world again, and that too clearly. And they would be allowed to return home, all jubilant and hopeful to lead a happy and independent life.Dr Ruit, popularly known as the God of Sight, along with his team has restored eyesight of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe, including in the most difficult terrains using high-quality microsurgical procedures. They have been carrying medical equipment needed for the cataract surgery, operating on the patients free of charge while ensuring they get quality treatment. The lenses used while doing so are the lowcost intraocular lenses that are manufactured at the TIO.A unique modelHad this camp been not organised at Doramba, for most of the patients who were operated here, it meant living with the impaired vision forever, as per Tilak Karki, Project Coordinator of the Community Development Society (CDS), Ramechhap, who said that blindness due to cataract has indeed affected the social and economic life of the people here. But the cataract surgery technique pioneered  Dr Ruit delivered to this area free of charge has given a new lease of life to these people.The TIO has been organising such camps regularly. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, they had been organising around 45 camps annually in Nepal where 7,000-8,000 cataract surgeries used to be conducted plus around 10-12 camps abroad, as per Namkhen Lama, Ophthalmic Officer at TIO. During the process, eye screening of 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh people would be done, while the number would increase if they would go abroad. Even after the COV- ID-19 hit the country, they held 20 camps last year, and 12 camps year before, as per Lama where they provide hospitalbased service and thus call them Outreach Microsurgical Eye Clinic (OMEC) rather than calling it just an eye camp.As per Lama, this is their fifth eye camp at Doramba- ""before organising the camp we did screenings in 18 places from where the patients arrived for the surgery - from Ramechhap (Doramba Rural Municipality, Khandadevi Rural Municipality, Sunapati Rural Municipality, and Manthali Municipality), Dolakha (Shailung Rural Municipality and Mailung Rural Municipality) along with a case from Sindhupalchowk"".""Our goal was to screen 2,200 people and operate on 300 cataracts, as per Lama. And they were successful with the target exceeding their expectation as they operated on 333 patients in one of the biggest camps in the hill district of Nepal.In this particular OMEC, supported  the Tej Kohli & Ruit Foundation, the TIO had brought its team to do the surgery, informed Lama. However, they also mobilised local partners for other kinds of arrangements - respective local levels did the publicity of the eye camp and screening camps while also arranging transportation of people from their households to the campsite. The Doramba Rural Municipality arranged the space for the camp along with arranging mattress and blankets for the patients. The CDS did the publicity of the eye screening in Sunapati Rural Municipality along with arranging feeding of patients and visitors. Likewise, the hospital staff of the Doramba Rural Municipality did the Antigen test, blood sugar and pressure test of the patients. The collaboration with local partners aided in making management of the camp efficient - a difficult task to accomplish while doing so single-handedly.And through this camp, the organisers wanted to prove something too. Dr Ruit elaborated, ""Doramba is near the capital city of Kathmandu in terms of distance, but is remote in terms of transportation facilities, geographical terrain and other facilities. We want to showcase that if the camp can be done in such a place, we can do it anywhere in the world.""That's exactly what Dr Rebecca Getacheal, an Ethiopian doctor, felt after seeing the camp.""What strikes me most is the topography - despite the difficult terrain where it takes hours for the patients to reach, people came for the surgery,"" said the cornea fellow at TIO, who is determined to organise similar camps back home. Along with that, the camp turned out to be a learning experience for these doctors including Dr Serey Seng (cornea fellow) and Dr Roma Eng (retina fellow) at TIO from Cambodia too where they got to watch and learn from Dr Ruit.A bigger goalWhile the eye camp at Doramba is just an example of what can be done despite the odds, Dr Ruit who has been putting lenses in the eyes of poor people free of charge for years has a bigger goal - to scale it up and take it to 10 other developing countries as part of South-to-South cooperation.Helping Dr Ruit meet his desire is British philanthropist Tej Kohli, who visited the camp two days in a row (on March 18 and 19) to see how things worked here.The Tej Kohli & Ruit Foundation, ""funded entirely from the private capital of Tej Kohli and the Kohli family"", has a plan to cure 300,000 to 500,000 cataract blindness in 10 countries that include Cambodia, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Ghana, Indonesia, Myanmar, Bhutan and India, among others.""Conducting 300,000 to 500,000 successful operations under Dr Ruit's command is not a joke. That itself is an achievement and I am sure we can achieve those marks,""Kohli said at a press briefing held at the camp on March 19 and added, ""To me it is almost life threatening to be a blind person. So, with Dr Ruit's leadership, we can eradicate any form of blindness and pave a path so that others can follow.""As they are diversifying the treatment to other countries, Kohli added, ""Our contribution together is for those countries where people can't afford these types of treatment.""However, the support of the Tej Kohli & Ruit Foundation for TIO began last year as ""with Mr Kohli's help we have been able to operate on about 12,000 cataract patients right across Nepal, particularly in indigenous and unprivileged communities, right from the eastern border of Nepal to the western border. And this has been a great help, especially this is such a timely help as because of COV- ID-19 some hospitals were about to be closed and this funding for cataract sponsorship kept the hospitals alive,"" informed Dr Ruit.This is just the start as ""we plan to do 20,000 to 25,000 surgeries every year to start with in Nepal, looking at the unprivileged and make sure we provide equitable services"" as per him.The confident doctor further claimed the quality of the outcome of the post-operations in situations like this is second to none: ""If you take a round at the University of Massachusetts or Cambridge University or the Royal Victorian Eye Hospital, the post-op results will not be very different from what you saw at Doramba.""But in rich countries, such surgeries ""will cost multiple times and so a lot of people can't afford it"", Kohli said as he reiterated their objective: ""So, I think it is one of our criteria to go to places where affordability is an issue."" Dr Ruit added, ""But we can't do it without Mr Tej Kohli's help and that's very clear.""So, what's the financial commitment that Kohli has made towards this project? ""It will be in millions of dollars. My contribution is going to be whatever it takes to do whatever it takes.And it has to be scaled up in a manner that is doable,"" assured Kohli, who has been contributing towards the treatment of cornea blindness for the last 12 to 15 years. Yet he was not very happy with cornea transplant because ""I believe in scalable things and it is hard to scale cornea blindness as the model has limitations where it can grow.""He was looking around to see where he could to scale his desire of giving sight to people and then Kohli ""met a friend who had heard about Dr Ruit"". He added, ""I heard his name twothree times, and when you hear the same name coming up two or three times, you know in one part of the world he has to be good. So, we reached out to him and convinced him to create this foundation together and see if you could help more people.""Now that they have joined hands, the collaboration is looking into the transfer of technology, as per Kohli who said, ""Equipment will be a part of this thing, training and the lenses too. Dr Ruit added, ""We have a fantastic group of surgeons in Tilganga who are looking forward to joining this mission. The good thing about Nepali cataract surgery is that we have been able to train others. What I think Mr Kohli sees is that this is a system that has been developed in a country like Nepal and it is very easy to export to another developing country.It is a beautiful example of South-to-South cooperation.""Tilganga also manufactures intraocular lenses for use in cataract surgeries, keeping costs to less than $4 a lens compared to $250 in the West, as per Dr Ruit.The lenses are exported to more than 70 countries at present and as of now six million lenses have been used for sight restoration purposes in Nepal and around the world - they are mostly used  the people who cannot otherwise afford it, he informed.Now, the plan is to relocate the lense manufacturing setup and build state-of- the-art facility to create a model production facility in Nepal, as per Dr Ruit. ""We want to take the manufacturing to a new setup to increase volume, and its reach has to be increased across the globe,"" he said as he informed that it will take around Rs 60 to Rs 70 crores to relocate the lense manufacturing setup, and increase the current production volume  four times. For that they have approached different organisations, including the Tej Kohli & Ruit Foundation though they are yet to commit, he said.Dr Ruit also informed that they have approached the government for the same and are hopeful though nothing has been done yet.",1

708,Workers in the eyes of political parties: Do take them for granted anymore,Routine of Nepal Banda,"The current government has held the local election amid doubts over whether it would be held or not. Except for Budhiganga Rural Municipality of Bajura district, the election in753 municipalities was completed on May 13, and the capacity of the respective parties has already been mandated  the voters.The defeat of some orthodox but well-branded election symbols in some key locations has forced the parties to think why this has happened. The defeat of such traditional symbols has given the message that we the present generation are not compelled to follow the direction of such parties anymore, and that the parties should now give the opportunity to the new generation at every level of policy-making.While the parties were fielding candidates, some activists in the labour sector also got an opportunity to be nominated and get elected as well even though there were no reservations for them. This should help labour issues to come to the limelight. For a long time now, the parties have been neglecting to implement the voices of the workers, who are demanding that there be a 10 percent representation of the workers in policy-making at every level.However, now that some have been elected from the labour sector to the posts of members and chief of the local levels will definitely help in exposing the problems of the workers.The labour movement has been going on in Nepal for a long time now. The significant contribution made  the workers in establishing the republic during the people's movement is not hidden from anyone. It is not clear why the parties have been stingy in keeping the workers at the policy-making level in their constitution.As a recent example, even the Maoist party president, Prachanda, who considers himself the messiah of the proletariat, made a commitment at a meeting of the trade union last September to have a 10 percent representation of the workers in every structure of the party, starting from its central committee, but failed to come through his commitment while implementing it. This is an example of the tendency of the party leaders to show commitment but back out during its implementation. However, the CPN (UML) seems to have institutionally represented some of its MPs in the federal and provincial parliaments from its trade union.In the local level elections, the parties included labour issues in their election manifestos. Accordingly, the Nepali Congress and the UML included almost similar issues in them. There is talk of guaranteeing minimum wages, implementing contribution-based social security, and registering workers at the local level.Similarly, it has been mentioned that the Nepali Congress will form a Labour Advisory Council under the chairmanship of the chief of each local level with representatives of labour organisations and employers. It remains to be seen how the parties will implement the commitments made in the manifesto through their local governments.The main objective of any party is to make the country prosperous  eradicating poverty, as the country cannot do so unless there is economic and social transformation in the standard of living of the workers working in the in formal sector.It is important for the political parties to keep in mind data made available  the Labour Survey 2017- 2018, which shows that there are more than 7 million workers in the country, with more than 5.9 million working in the informal sector alone. That number has definitely increased over the years. It is said that about 600,000 new workers enter the labour market of Nepal every year.Currently, all local levels should be focused on registering workers in the informal sector and issuing identity cards, guaranteeing minimum wages, setting up labour help desks, arranging contribution-based social security for them, and forming a Labor Advisory Council representing both the employers and workers under the chairmanship of the municipality head. It is advisable to form such a council as per the manifesto because if there are any workers' issues, it can resolve them.So far, the parties seem to have used the working class only as a vote bank. The National Conference of the Nepal Trade Union Congress (NTUC), affiliated to the Nepali Congress, was held on June 12-13, while the conference of the UML-affiliated General Federation of Nepalese Trade Union (GEFONT) is nearing. The NTUC has passed a 23-point resolution, including the need for a 10 percent workers' representation in the state and party structures.The resolutions being passed are not completely new, but passing them at repeated conferences indicates non-implementation at the state level. Thus, the trade unions need to put pressure on the political parties to represent workers at the policy-making level while implementing labour-friendly issues.The labour sector has been in turmoil for the last two years due to the coronavirus pandemic, which mainly has had a direct impact on the daily wages workers. That class is in the process of getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Now, it is up to the governments at the local level to address their problems.It cannot be said that the day when the youth rebelled and defeated the traditional brands, in spite of each party having a youth and student wing, will not be repeated. Similarly, if the workers too rebel for their existence, the political party and system may face a difficult situation. Therefore, the parties have to accept the existence of the workers, only then will the country be prosperous through economic and social transformation of the workers.National Vice President of Nepal Trade Union Congress, Rai is an executive member of International Transport Works Federation, UK.",1

Oli is angry with Nepal for supporting Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba's bid for prime ministership on May 21 and challenging Oli's move to dissolve the House of Representatives in the Supreme Court. Deuba was appointed the new PM yesterday after the SC ruling. One-hundred-and-forty-six members of the dissolved HoR, including Deuba and Nepal had challenged the PM's move dissolving the HoR and the Supreme Court had also delivered its verdict on Monday in favour of the petitioners.Oli yesterday called those party lawmakers that supported Deuba and challenged the HoR dissolution saboteurs whose action had led to the fall of his government.Oli's anger against Nepal is an indication that reconciliation between the establishment faction of the UML led  Oli and the rival faction led  Madhav Kumar Nepal-Jhalanath Khanal won't be easy.

711,Gachhadar unposts million-rupee bail,Routine of Nepal banda,"Former deputy prime minister and vice-president of Nepali Congress Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, who has been indicted in Lalita Niwas land grab case, appeared before the Special Court today and posted a bail of Rs 1 million. Bench of Special Court Chairman Prem Raj Karki, judges Abdul Aziz Musalman and Nityananda Pandey that conducted the trial hearing after Gachhadar appeared before the court asked him to post a bail of Rs 1 million.The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority had filed on 6 February 2020 a corruption case against 175 individuals, including Gachhadar and former ministers Chandradev Joshi and Dambar Shrestha, for their alleged role in the infamous case.The CIAA had accused Gachhadar of embezzling Rs 9.65 crore.Gachhadar's lawyer Senior Advocate Harihar Dahal told the bench that since the proposal related to the expansion of roads and construction of buildings in Baluwatar areas where VIPs lived was prepared at the special instruction of the then prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and was endorsed collectively  the Cabinet, Gachhadar had no individual role in it. Dahal said Gachhadar being the line minister had only put his signature on the proposal that had to be forwarded to the Cabinet. Dahal said the CIAA recorded the statement of former PM Nepal and after being convinced with his arguments, it decided not to file a case against him. The same criteria should have been applied in the case of Gachhadar, he added.As per anti-graft laws, Cabinet decisions cannot come under the purview of the CIAA. The CIAA had stated in the chargesheet that the government had duly acquired 284 ropani land of Lalit Niwas but after restoration of democracy in 1990 those land plots were illegally transferred in individuals' names.Sharada Prasad Trital-led probe committee had submitted its report saying the government had forfeited only 14 ana land of Subarna Shumsher JB Rana and had paid compensation to him for acquiring 284 ropani land.Rana's kin claimed that the Panchayat government had confiscated 299 ropani land in Baluwatar that belonged to them.The post democratic-era government returned only those land plots that were forfeited  the government in 1960 to punish Subarna Shumsher and Kanchan Shumsher for championing the cause of democracy.Forty-two defendants accused in Lalita Niwas land grab case are yet to appear before the Special Court to contest the case.",1

714,"Booster shots not needed against omicron, CDC studies show",Routine of Nepal banda,"Three studies released Friday offered more evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are standing up to the omicron variant, at least among people who received booster shots.They are the first large U.S. studies to look at vaccine protection against omicron, health officials said. The papers echo previous research - including studies in Germany, South Africa and the U.K. - indicating available vaccines are less effective against omicron than earlier versions of the coronavirus, but also that boosters doses rev up virus-fighting antibodies to increase the chance of avoiding symptomatic infection.The first study looked at hospitalizations and emergency room and urgent care center visits in 10 states, from August to this month.It found vaccine effectiveness was best after three doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care visits. Protection dropped from 94% during the delta wave to 82% during the omicron wave. Protection from just two doses was lower, especially if six months had passed since the second dose.Officials have stressed the goal of preventing not just infection but severe disease. On that count, some good news: A third dose was at least 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations for COVID-19, both during the delta and omicron periods, the study also found.The second study focused on COVID-19 case and death rates in 25 states from the beginning of April through Christmas. People who were boosted had the highest protection against coronavirus infection, both during the time delta was dominant and also when omicron was taking over.Those two articles were published online  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Journal of the American Medical Association published the third study, also led  CDC researchers. It looked at people who tested positive for COVID-19 from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1 at more than 4,600 testing sites across the U.S.Three shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were about 67% effective against omicron-related symptomatic disease compared with unvaccinated people. Two doses, however, offered no significant protection against omicron when measured several months after completion of the original series, the researchers found.""It really shows the importance of getting a booster dose,"" said the CDC's Emma Accorsi, one of the study's authors.Americans should get boosters if at least five months have passed since they completed their Pfizer or Moderna series, but millions who are eligible have not gotten them.""If you are eligible for a booster and you haven't gotten it, you are not up to date and you need to get your booster,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing Friday.

724,eye donation in Nepal: 170-time donor Prem Sagar Karmacharya highlights problems and solutions,Routine of Nepal banda,"Every Thursday and Friday, thousands of people walked on the pavement near Bhugol Park of Kathmandu, hearing the jingle “Raktadan Gari Garau Jeevan Daan” (Blood donation is life donation) play in the background. But, in the hustling crowd, people rarely have time to listen to the jingle or even step into the park premises and volunteer for blood donation.On the other hand is a person who has managed to do blood donation every three months, all his adult life. To date, Prem Sagar Karmacharya has donated blood 170 times and is ready for his next in July.But amidst the people who rarely even turn their heads to the blood donation campaigns happening around them, how did Karmacharya manage to donate blood all 170 times? Karmcharya shares he was self-motivated to do social work with a great influence from his father. “My father used to give first aid to labourers and field workers who got injured. When I was a kid, I used to tag along with him everywhere and I picked up a few things from him.”“But I started blood donation after a friend encouraged me to do so. I started donating blood early [at 16] and have not stopped since.”With over 12 years of work experience in the blood donation field, Karmacharya is apparently recognised as the person with the highest number of blood donations in Nepal. Also the central president of Nepal Voluntary Blood Donors’ Society (NVBDS), Karmacharya is sought after  people from near and far struggling to fetch the blood for medical procedures. He says the trust he has won from the people for being able to provide the blood and convincing people to be regular blood donors are his biggest achievements. Nevertheless, he is unhappy with the present scenario of blood donation and its circulation, adding he is ambitious regarding his plans to correct them in the near future. The Karmacharya family migrated to Bagbazaar in 1971 from Jaisidewal of Kathmandu. He remembers how times have changed and how he could see Tundikhel from his area clearly. But, what has not changed, he says, is the irregularity of blood donation and its circulation in the blood market. “In the 1980s, near the Bir Hospital, where the National Trauma Centre is today, blood was sold  the Laxmi Blood Bank under the Red Cross, operated under the government. And even today, where the blood that should be given voluntarily and provided freely, it is being sold within a syndicate.”“There is the National Blood Transfusion Policy, but it is not implemented. The government has held Red Cross responsible, but it is driven  nepotism and favouritism. Red Cross is selling the blood that they get free of cost from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC). Can anything be more inhumane and more sadist than that?” he asks.Meanwhile, he adds, the government is demotivating blood donors and exploiting patients  putting a higher price on the transfusable blood. “I was disheartened to see that Runa Jha who came in one of our programmes and pledged to address our concerns was the signatory in the decision.” Additionally, the public is not bothered to track where their blood is going either, which is why the irregularities are being more rampant.“Blood donation should be done with everyone’s coordination. And, most importantly, it has to be voluntary. World Health Organization (WHO) is also working towards the same,” says Karmacharya. But, it is not the case in practice. “Forced or coerced blood donation is a crime and so is selling blood. It is unethical and inhumane yet they are still being practised rampantly. Some organisations are selling blood at a price whereas others doing it under the premise of replacement (where the blood bank demands blood in exchange for blood). At hospitals, they draw blood without permission and then sell that later in the market.”While he is full of complaints, he also has ideas to build a network where the current system can be corrected so that people get blood freely and as needed. “But, neither the government nor the authorities are extending their hand to collaborate and bring about the change.”His own attempt Witnessing all the ongoing irregularities and tired of hearing that blood is “not available” when needed, Karmacharya decided to start his own organisation, Nepal Voluntary Blood Donors’ Society in January of 2009. The organisation runs with a network of volunteers who collect and provide blood for people in need. So far, it has 33 chapters across Nepal already. Today, his team is arranging blood with prior notice only, but it has plans to correct that. “As we do not have a blood bank as of now, we do not store the blood, we keep a few to spare, but a lot is done under a network where we connect the people and patients. But, if the irregularity and rampant blood market are under play, we will have to set it up.”“We are also working on integrating technology where donors can track. It will take some time, but once live, people can know their blood has been put to good use. However, we are strictly against making the details of the donors and patients public.”Blood donation is not blood loss Karmacharya, at 58, is very much active even today not just in donating blood himself. But, he is also encouraging others to do so, in line with this year’s World Blood Donor’s Day theme “Donating blood is an act of solidarity. Join the effort and save lives”.“I ask that every individual 18-65 years of age, capable and healthy, should actively engage in blood donation and encourage their friends and family to do it too. They can donate every three months without any repercussions.” Though blood donation is clouded in speculations, he says, “I have no bodily problems whatsoever. I have not taken any medicines per se. But, when I get sick, I use home remedies to cure my fever or cold. Other than that, I would attest that blood donation can prevent cholesterol and cardio(vascular) diseases that otherwise people are very prone to, given their lifestyle and eating habits. I am the proof of it.” He adds, “Humans only need 50 ml/kg to function whereas (on average) men have 76 mil/kg and women have 66 ml/kg so we will only donate what is in access.”He further explains that one person donating blood can impact the lives of up to three people. “In the lab, the blood is centrifuged and separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma or we use the whole blood where the blood is used for transfusion as it is.”But, his request to all is that blood should not be wasted in any form. “Please use or demand blood only as needed. Having a backup is not a problem, but excessive drawing out of blood or demanding blood will result in wastage of blood that will take up to three months to recover. So, everyone needs to be mindful. We must aim to efficiently use even a single drop of blood.”

725,"Mobile Library goes dynamic in Kathmandu. But, it’ll still create momentum in Nepali art",Routine of Nepal banda,"Some ends are new beginnings. After two years of presence in Nepal, the Asia Art Archive (AAA) is moving out of Nepal, after handing over Mobile Library Nepal to Tribhuvan University.With the handover, the AAA programme manager and head of learning and participation, Susanna Chung, hopes it will further encourage local educational institutions and students to spend more time on deliberation, research and capacity building. Mobile Library is the project started  Chung in AAA Hong Kong in 2010 on the occasion of its 10-year anniversary. “I was working as a librarian in Hong Kong when we conceptualised the project. AAA is a big archive and we wanted to take the books to countries where the access was not as easy.”The mobile library project first went to Vietnam. The idea was to counter the ongoing censorship in the country and increase access to books regarding contemporary art reading materials. “We partnered with the local organisation–Sàn Art–and collected some 800 books,” she shares.The project then went to Sri Lanka, Myanmar and then Nepal for its fourth edition. It is also the project’s longest edition which ran for more than two years. In Nepal, AAA collaborated with Siddhartha Arts Foundation to give continuation to their bid to promote art literature in Nepal.But, it is over now, yet it is not the end.Whenever people talk about art literature, the resources are always less. Nepal has fewer resources and access as well.Sangeeta Thapa of Siddhartha Arts Foundation had already noticed the gap as a stakeholder working in the Nepali art sector. During her trip to Hongkong, Thapa got to know about AAA’s project and then inquired about the organisation’s archive of Nepal. However, she found nothing and that encouraged her to ask the organisation to make efforts to conduct research and collect books on Nepali art history and contemporary art, despite its progress. Seeing the gap, Thapa insisted the AAA group come to Nepal and collect books that cover the local art fraternity and benefit them. “In 2019, we conducted an extensive survey in art colleges/universities and among the artists so that we could get a list and curate a special collection of books.”Chung says the AAA team also realised the need to be here and approached collaborators that showed common interest to share knowledge and educate people. “The countries we have focused on have common traits like a lack of reading habits, art education and a lack of infrastructures. These countries also had more western influence but in need of more local perspective, in its art history and contemporary art practices.”According to the Mobile Library Nepal organisers, this library already contains around 600 books, exhibition catalogues, periodicals, and monographs including works of popular Nepali art writers like Madan Chitrakar, Yam Prasad Sharma, Ram Dayal Rakesh, Mukesh Malla, Laya Mainali, and Ramesh Khanal. The team says because Nepal did not have many locally written books, it took a bit more time.Throughout the project, Mobile Library also conducted a range of online and on-site educational discourses and programmes including reading circles, archive-building workshops, outreach programmes, teacher-training programmes, and pop-up exhibitions. “The idea of the project was to make the library more accessible. The bookshelves are designed in such a way that they can be boxed and moved around. They are more static in nature, yet we wanted to take them to more places and reach more students and people. So, we acquired that in two years,” Samira Bose, a programme coordinator at AAA, shares. More than the access, she shares that the Mobile Library project has been able to culminate more bonds with local artists too. “Yet, we could not reach Janakpur as we intended, due to Covid restrictions.”“We have focused our programmes on training and capacity building that ultimately guides the teachers to explore more. Our programmes also extended with fellowships, in which we trained seven art enthusiasts here who can become our future ambassadors and work for our cause.”“The team is digitising the bibliography for six more months.”  The Mobile Library Nepal project had started in the first week of February 2021 and concluded after two years in an official handover programme held on the premises of the Department of Fine Arts, in Tribhuvan University, Balkhu, recently. Associate Professor Sangita Pradhan, the head of the Central Department of Fine Arts at the university, says she is very happy that the mobile library has reached TU. “When I came to know about the project, I insisted to the team that it has to be kept at the TU, given its large number of students and a separate department as well as all possible future artists to benefit from the rich resources.”She adds, “We do not have enough books for our students. If we have to buy the books we have to get them from India, while our budget does not support the purchase of the books that we want in our library. But, the Mobile Library Nepal has researched and collected so many resourceful books that will no doubt support the academic growth of our students.”Pradhan, also a singer, expresses she has more plans to promote Nepali art, and especially music, as it has long been sidelined. “Seeing the research and collection, I have requested the AAA team to help us in collecting more books on Nepali music genre too. And, I am hopeful about that too.”After the handover, Pradhan will be ensuring the safekeeping of the books. She also welcomes students from outside the TU too to come and explore for their own academic growth. “Anyone can drop  and get the reference for their growth, academically or skill-wise.”Chung says the overseas team together with the Nepal team will continue to expand the library so that they can help students of all disciplines here. “Like in Sri Lanka, we hope the project thrives here too. The key is to have a custodian who takes charge and continues the project themes, like an ongoing mission.”",1
726,The Horizon folds with Kathmandu school students hosting an art exhibition,Routine of Nepal banda,"With an aim to give its students a platform and showcase their talent, Bijeswori Secondary School in Kathmandu organised an art exhibition titled The Horizon Unfolds: An Exhibition of Artworks. It features paintings and sculptures of more than 60 students of the school. The exhibitors include fine arts students in grades 11 and 12, other interested students from grades 8 to 10 and some passed out students.The Horizon Unfolds unfolded on Wednesday at Nepal Art Council, Babermahal. The students have worked in various mediums such as watercolour, acrylic, oil, charcoal, pen and ink. It gives a glimpse of the new generation of artists and what could be expected in the future.Suraj Shrestha, an 11th grader, using charcoal on paper, has created ‘Life takes a direction’. His work has a hand with a compass, and the composition looks futuristic. A former student Looja Manandhar created a portrait of an old man using charcoal on paper. All the details of wrinkles, facial hairs and composition make it one of the best charcoal arts on the display.Currently, the school is teaching the ninth batch of fine arts in the plus two classes and you can see multidimensional aspects of the artists.About the exhibition, Bindu Tuladhar, the founder and principal of the school, shares, “I am overjoyed to present to the audience our annual art exhibition that comprises beautiful artworks  our students. Continuing with our trend, this time around also, the show focuses on enhancing the creativity and talent of the students, encouraging them to pursue art thoughtfully.”Moreover, in the exhibition, conceptual works and charcoal works stand out. The conceptual works  these students not only give the viewer a chance to look into young minds but make one awestruck  their imagination.Artist, art writer and curator Saroj Bajracharya, also the coordinator of the school, agrees, “There are a few students whose work are stunning and I was simply awestricken. Moreover, as an art educator, I felt these students have full support from their parents. The way they are confident in using colours and their composition shows it. This is a very positive notion for the art scenario as parents usually did not support those students who wanted to pursue art education in the past.”Another 11th grader, Jenish Shrestha, has painted two conceptual paintings and both are powerful visually and conceptually. In her works, Shrestha searches for the meaning of identity and beauty. Similarly, Pariden Regmi in his self-portrait titled, Inside Out, has explored his own self and how he has been growing up, using motifs like flowers, and mushrooms.",1
727,Chorko Swor: Kathmandu’s old theatrical show is a full entertainment package as it’s eloquent about elopement,Routine of Nepal banda,"Those were the days when elopement was a common thing in society. However, things have changed since then. These days, they exist rarely.

In the play Chorko Swor being staged at Mandala Theatre currently, however, the viewers are taken somewhere around the Limbu community, in particular, in the Chemjong village and a wedding ceremony is taking place in presence of the villagers. A 19-year-old boy, Bhimhang (Prabin Magar), and a girl named Pangli Seema (Nusa Lingden), originally from Sherma village, are tying the knot after Pangli’s successful elopement.

When the groom’s party arrives at the bride’s party for Chorko Swor, the main drama begins. The title of the drama refers to the Limbu ritual, in which the groom’s family informs the bride’s family of their marriage and assures her that she is now their family.

But, the drama is not only about that.In general, when the bride’s family is informed of the elopement and marriage, the bride’s family feels its ego bruised and does not accept their relationship easily. When the groom’s party reaches the bride’s home, her family even attacks the groom’s side. Nevertheless, they are somehow convinced that nothing can be done as they are already married and it is better for both the families to accept them. This shows the power of love.

Chorko Swor, the play written  Nabin Chauhan, depicts the culture of elopement specific to the Limbu community. The play realistically presents different aspects of elopement that exist in the Limbu community especially.  The setting of the play is very simple. It features just a few props such as the traditional house that is usually seen in the Limbu community, a place to prepare alcohol, a sty and a bridge made up of bamboo.The play takes place in two places: the Chemjong and Sherma villages. With a few changes, both the places feature the same setting. The setting and the locals’ gossip on marriage, politics and development give you a local vibe. It makes you feel as if you are really around the Limbu community.  Several things occur during the play. They usually make you laugh, but they can also make you cry. That is something that will keep you hooked throughout the play.Prior to seeing off the bride after the ceremony, an emotional conversation takes place among her brother, a cousin of the groom, Struggle (Prayas Bantawa Rai) and his sister, also the sister-in-law of the bride, Manmaya (Laxmi Yonghang). This conversation is so emotional that it leaves some of the audience in tears. Every character has performed admirably in the play directed  Anil Subba and Anwesh Rai Thulung. Their natural acting has made the play vibrant and genuine. The play has altogether 19 characters and all of them are equally significant to make this play beautiful and worth watching.The entire play incorporates a Limbu accent in the dialogue and the actors have done justice to the dialogue delivery.The wedding function features various characters that are usually seen in normal Nepali weddings. Some of them are entirely busy with handling cameras, some of them are only concerned about alcohol and some of them are always busy flirting with the girls. These characters make the play more relevant. The power of Chorko Swor rests in a simple presentation; it does not have any fancy lighting and setup. These aspects of the play have made it more realistic.  With that, the play also allows the audience to witness Dhan Naach, a traditional dance of the Limbu community. The dance is accompanied  a traditional song and drum. It also features the tradition of juhari, where a solta (cousin brother of the groom) tries to impress solti (cousin sister of the bride) for marriage,  romantic verses. In this section, instrumental music of the Nepali popular song, Teenpatey-Dekhera Timilai, another Artmandu production, is played in the background. Artmandu did not miss a chance to promote its work graciously. The two-hour play will not make you bored at any time. It ends on an unexpected note that includes fun, action, and emotion. To know more about the play, visit the theatre and watch the show. Chorko Swor will run through June 29 at 5:00 pm every day except Monday in Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun. There will be an additional show on Saturday at 1:00 pm.",1
728,PK Sherpa: An unpromising dream does not leads to a promising career–at the peak of Nepal’s mountaineering industry,Routine of Nepal banda,"Growing up in his village in the Sotang rural municipality in lower Solukhumbu, Pasang Kaji Sherpa (popularly known as PK Sherpa) never thought he would get into mountaineering. No one from his village had ever been a mountaineer. Most of them were into agriculture with only a few venturing out of the village becoming porters or guides for trekking groups.

That is how PK Sherpa started his journey into mountaineering. At the tender age of 13, he joined a trekking group as a porter and ventured out to make a living for himself. But deep down, he would always be looking at the mountains, hoping and dreaming that one day, he too would be on the summit of the highest peaks in the world.

In the 15 years, he has been mountaineering; he has seen a lot. There have been many ups and downs. From the horror of people dying in the mountains to the ecstasy of people summitting, his life has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. 

Now, as PK Sherpa is reaching the peak of his career, he wants to inspire the younger generation of climbers  setting an example on the mountain. In doing so, he wants to continue his evolution as a mountaineer as he believes that it is a sport that has no margin of error. He hopes the government will bring in favourable policies to produce skilled mountaineers to create a favourable environment for the industry.

Failure and resilience
“Like in life, you have to evolve in the mountains too. Or else, it can be detrimental,” says Sherpa.

Getting into mountaineering was not a straightforward journey for PK Sherpa. During his time as a trekking guide, he would often come across mountaineers in the Everest region who would be partying after a successful expedition. Looking at them, he would feel envious. His inner self wanted something similar.

“Back then, I felt the life as a mountain guide was better than trekking guide when compared in terms of money and recognition. The mountain guide got it more, which is why I wanted to switch.”

So, since then, he has scaled Everest seven times.

But, he did not know where to start back then. No one from PK Sherpa’s hometown had been into mountaineering. And with no skill, he knew it would be foolish to go climbing. With that in mind, he applied to take training offered  the Nepal Mountaineering Association in 2005. But, his application was rejected. Adamant, he decided to go to the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling in India. But, he could not get in because he did not have enough money to take part in the courses the institute offered.

“It was discouraging. So I came back and took a course on becoming a trekking guide and spent a few years travelling Nepal with groups.”

Onto peaks with promisesIn 2007, during a trekking trip to Tibet, PK Sherpa got his first taste of mountaineering when he climbed a 6,000-metre mountain with his cousins and clients. Even though he had not been to any mountain prior to this, mountaineering came naturally to him. He reached the top with relative ease, but coming down was a different story.
“I didn’t know how to come down. It was scary because one mistake would mean death and that is the day when I realised the importance of training.”Following the trip, he came back to Nepal and took the basic and advanced mountaineering courses offered  the Nepal Mountain Instructors Association. That training gave him the confidence he could climb any mountain and later in spring, he left with his cousins for Tibet to take on the world’s highest mountain—Everest.He did not summit that year, but he learnt a lot about how hard climbing an 8,000-metre mountain was. He saw deaths on the mountain. He saw people going crazy due to a lack of oxygen. It was there that he understood what he had chosen as a profession.In autumn of the same year, PK Sherpa returned to Tibet to climb Cho Oyu. Even with the most basic gears, he summitted the mountain. But, he knew that he needed to train more if he was to get any better at it.“I started to enrol myself for various courses. This was the time when I started to send my son to school. It’s funny because in a way we both were going to school,” Sherpa jokes.In the spring of 2009, PK Sherpa went to Everest again, this time from the south side (Nepal) and reached the summit. But, that did not make him cocky or arrogant because he knew that if he wanted to do this for long, he needed to train. That is when he started to take training led  the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association. The NNMGA was on the verge of being associated with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Association and he understood what this would mean.“Being an international mountain guide meant you would get better opportunities. That’s not it, the training that I took made me a better climber. I can get out of tough spots and rescue my client too.”During his bid to become an internationally recognised guide, he worked with foreign companies learning the basics of mountaineering and how to conduct a safe expedition. Sherpa says he saw how much these people focused on safety. They also had a calorie guide and asked each client and support staff to maintain it. “I was impressed with the attention to detail they have during their expedition.”Highs and lows of the careerDuring this time, PK Sherpa also met mountaineer, filmmaker and photographer Elia Saikaly, who has been his climbing partner ever since. Working with him, he started to get into photography too.“I was already interested, but working with him I started to enjoy it more. I would take my camera on every expedition. It’s turned into a passion now,” says Sherpa.Following the completion of his IFMGA training, he got better opportunities too. He guided multiple foreign expeditions to the top of Everest and also worked with a team from Google. But, he always craved for more. In 2015, the year of the earthquake, he and a few others were planning to climb six mountains in a season, but things did not go as planned. He had also planned to climb two unclimbed peaks, Hillary and Tenzing, but due to poor weather and other circumstances, he had to call off the bid.“It was still a great experience because I didn’t climb as a guide. I climbed the mountain like a mountaineer. But, it was hard because the soft snow on the mountain made it dangerous to climb,” PK Sherpa says.But, it was still worth it as he climbed a mountain for the first time as a climber. He says that this is what he likes about Nepalis nowadays. He feels the increased number of people attracted to climbing is good for the sport. But that said, he does feel the government needs to do more to create an environment for this.Overcoming the challenges PK Sherpa says the Sherpa community cannot sustain the industry on its own, adding he likes that more people from other communities have started to work as guides on the mountain. But, he does say that due to nepotism, things are not as smooth for them.“Like everywhere, nepotism is rampant in the mountaineering industry too.”But, PK Sherpa says this is not a problem right now. The problem is the government is not active in producing high-quality mountain guides. He feels the government should spend the royalty it gets from mountains like Everest and invest it in the climbers and develop high-quality guides.“The government was handing out mountain guide licences to anyone, but what they should do is spend the money to develop people’s capacity because we don’t have enough skilled people on the mountains,” says Sherpa.“This would mean that we would earn more. If Nepal had better guides, people will use our service instead of foreign ones. That would mean more money stays in our economy. The government needs to think beyond the 11,000 USD it gets as royalty if they don’t, things will remain the same.”PK Sherpa also urges the government to change its archaic mindset and promote different activities that take place in the mountain. He says the government should be strict on the regulation of these activities and promote things like skiing and paragliding.“What the government did to Sano Babu Sunuwar and Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa was wrong,” he says pointing out to the two being arrested after paragliding from Everest in 2011.“ They had tried everything, but the government did not help and they both said to hell with this and paraglided off.”PK Sherpa feels the government needs to understand what can and cannot be done on the mountain. He says it was time the country evolved because if it did not, it would be too late.",1
729,The rise of communicable diseases: A persistent epidemic in Nepal,Routine of Nepal banda,"Jan Maya Tamang, 45, cannot go around on her own. Working at a brick kiln since the age of 15, she has been suffering from respiratory issues for a few years now. Not getting the right treatment in time made her respiratory issues worse as she was diagnosed with asthma, a non-communicable disease, and pneumonia, a communicable one, and has been making the rounds of hospitals for over two years. “I find it hard to breathe. My chest hurts all the time and my legs are always weak. I can’t do anything,” she says.Likewise, Hari Dhakal from Kavre has another issue, high blood pressure. He had left Nepal to go work in South Korea, but due to high blood pressure, he had no option but to come back to Nepal as he just could not deal with the stress there. “I had to return because it didn’t come under control. Things are similar here too, which is why I regularly take medicines,” says Dhakal.The number of people suffering from non-communicable diseases in Nepal is as high as it has ever been. If you go to any hospital, you will see hundreds of people queuing up to get treatments for high blood pressure, lung diseases, kidney issues, stones, and stomach and intestinal issues among others. These diseases are not only posing a threat to people’s well-being but also showing the failures of Nepal’s fragile health system.A risky rise Radha Devi from Indra Chok in Kathmandu needed to use the restroom quite often. She also got hungry very quickly and would get tired frequently. She did not know what was going on and went to the doctors who diagnosed her with diabetes. Along with that, she also has asthma.“I can’t work like I used to because I get tired very quickly,” says Radha Devi. “I’ve been told my blood pressure is high too and have been on watch at what I eat.”There are many people facing chronic and non-communicable diseases. Last year, nearly 14,000 people went to Bir Hospital for treatment. Out of that, most people were there for pneumonia and gallbladder stone treatments followed  high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, kidney-related infection, diabetes, malignant neoplasm of the rectum, hernia, and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.People with similar issues were found at TU Teaching Hospital and Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences.“This shows how people are not taking care of their lifestyle and eating habits, which are causing a rise in the number of patients with these non-communicable yet chronic diseases,” says public health expert Dr Kedar Baral.While most of these are non-communicable diseases, pneumonia is one communicable disease that affects a lot of people, especially those who have poor immunity power.“Pneumonia is dangerous because it makes people weak which affects other organs of the body,” says pulmonologist Raju Pangeni.But, the main issue right now is the non-communicable diseases that have seen a rise over the past few years, killing a lot of people. The reason for the rise of non-communicable diseases according to doctors and health experts is people’s unhealthy lifestyles and eating habits. Pulmonologist Dr Neeraj Bam says there has been a rise in non-communicable diseases mostly in developing countries.Also read – Diabetes is becoming one of the biggest killers in Nepal. Here’s everything you need to know about the risk What do the surveys indicate? With a rise in these diseases, the number of people dying is also high. There are data to prove this too. Between 2016 and 2018, a survey was conducted  the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health and Population that stated 91 per cent of deaths that took place in the country were due to non-communicable diseases.

Over 13,000 people participated in the survey across 72 districts in the country. The report published in 2019 stated that most people dying from non-communicable diseases were from chronic respiratory diseases (11.7 per cent) followed  diabetes (8.5 per cent), kidney disease (6 per cent) and heart disease (3 per cent). The Health Ministry did its own survey in 2019, and it showed that 90 per cent of people in OPDs of government hospitals were suffering from non-communicable diseases.“This is because of what we eat. Back in the day, people were healthy because they ate organic food and were physically active. But, that isn’t the case right now. People don’t eat well, are lazy and have a lot of stress. Add smoking and drinking to the equation and you have a recipe for disaster,” says Dr Bam. What has not helped is the poor quality of air people breathe currently which might not show instant impact, but in the long term is slowly killing people, claim pulmonologists. Dr Bam says that due to poor lifestyle, people’s immunity is also low compared to what it was before. He says the air quality also poses a major threat as it directly affects people’s lungs and causes non-communicable diseases like asthma, high blood pressure and kidney-related diseases. This risk increases in people who smoke or use tobacco. “Smoking decreases people’s immunity power. People need to understand this and start taking steps to improve their health,” says Dr Bam. Another chronic lung disease is asthma. Pulmonologist Dr Pangeni says heredity plays a role in asthma, but people also get diagnosed with it due to air pollution and changing weather.“Air pollution causes allergies and they cause asthma. This isn’t something that only old people have. Young people can also have it and if not diagnosed quickly, causes a lot of problems in the future,” says Dr Pangeni.“In our country, most elderly people die of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People diagnosed with this find it hard to breathe and in many cases also develop pneumonia,” says Dr Pangeni, adding this is curable if treated on time.He adds if the government does not try to find a solution to the increasing air pollution, death due to CPOD will continue to increase. “It has long term effects and that means when diagnosed it will already be too late,” says Dr Pangeni.High blood pressure on the rise.Another non-communicable disease is high blood pressure. According to research, around 45 per cent of men in the country will be diagnosed with high blood pressure  2025. The research also states Nepal saw a 13 per cent rise in high blood pressure cases in men in the past two decades.

“Men over 30 who live in urban areas face this problem more than women and people who live in rural areas,” says Dr Raja Ram Dhungana, the researcher.

Cardiologist Dr Harihar Khanal assumes over 35 per cent of people in urban areas suffer from high blood pressure.

“Everyone household has one. This happens due to unhealthy eating habits, stress, laziness and excess drinking,” says Dr Khanal. “The only way to control this is medication, but people have to change their lifestyle too.” 

Dr Khanal says people should go to hospitals for regular check-ups because if their disease is diagnosed early on time, things can be improved.”

“High blood pressure causes heart attacks, heart diseases and kidney issues,” says Dr Khanal who says people have to change their lifestyle if they want to avoid high blood pressure.

In a survey conducted  the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division in 2019, around 4.7 million people in Nepal suffer from high blood pressure. Out of these, only 200,000 people’s blood pressure has come under control  taking medicines. Many do not even take medicine fearing its side effects.“This is a silent killer,” says cardiologist Om Murti Anil. “People only realise they have high blood pressure when it’s too late.” He says that the symptoms and causes of high blood pressure should be taught from the secondary level in school.Other reasons Cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer, kidney issues and tuberculosis have also increased. “People are also dying due to accidents and air pollution. The government has to raise awareness regarding these cases,” says Dr Khanal.If you go ask the government which disease kills the most people, they do not have an exact number. But, according to preliminary research  various organisations, heart-related issues kill the most number of people.“The Health Ministry knows this. It knows that non-communicable diseases are killing Nepalis. This is an epidemic on its own,” says Dr Krishna Prasad Paudel from the ministry. “We have worked a lot to control communicable diseases. Now, it’s time to work on non-communicable diseases.”Dr Paudel says the government brought a multisector work plan to combat non-communicable diseases. “We have brought a plan, but we need everybody’s help from all sectors for its success,” says Dr Paudel.The work plan aims to decrease the death of people via non-communicable diseases  25 per cent  2025 and 33 per cent  2030.“If non-communicable diseases increase at the rate as they are increasing now, our health sector won’t be able to cope with it,” says Dr Paudel. “We are serious about combating this, but we need people from all sectors to help us. But, we’ve been here before”, say public health experts.Policies like these have been made before, but there have always been problems when it comes to their implementation. Public health expert Dr Sharad Wanta says policies like not allowing people to smoke in public are brought, but they are never implemented.“It’s small things like these that make a difference,” says Wanta. Public health expert Dr Kedar Baral, however, says people need to change their way of life too and the government alone cannot solve it.This story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.",1
730,Maulik: 8 contemporary artists’ masterpieces in different place,Routine of Nepal banda,"The relationship between a couple is always seen as special. Then, there are relationships between friends and families. This very special relationship between eight contemporary artists helped in organising a group art exhibition, Maulik: A venture of 8 contemporary artists.The exhibition kicked off on Friday at Nepal Art Council, Babermahal, and like the title of the exhibition, each one of the artists—Ishan Pariyar, Anisha Maharjan, Laxam Bazra Lama, Deepmala Maharjan, Namrata Singh, Sabita Dangol, Deepak Thami and Nilesh Shakya—have created masterpieces of their own.Pleasant execution of artworks Maulik is displayed on the ground floor of the gallery. While entering there, you can feel a pleasant vibration due to the colourful display of artworks and how they have been placed inside the gallery. The exhibition is aesthetically pleasing and lets you go into a happy colourful world.Although being friends and four married couples, it showcases distinct artworks on the themes like the relationship of a mother and a daughter, human senses, love, hope, identity, desire and more that are entirely different from each other, using symbolism in their paintings and sculpture.Symbols like clouds, lotus, birds, flowers, and trees have been used in these artists’ paintings. In Lama’s and Thami’s paintings, the clouds symbolise the uncountable desires of a human in this world while s/he is alive. Then, flowers in Singh, Thami and Dangol’s paintings denote prosperity, calmness and beauty in life.The themes explored  the artistsIn Maulik, Pariyar’s paintings show his concern for Nepal’s heritage and have beautifully presented them with a blend of western and eastern motifs such as the Mona Lisa, Lord Narayan and more. Dangol’s works focus on the conjugal love and the ecstasy one gets being in such a relationship.Then, using the monochromatic theme in red, Anisha Maharjan has depicted a girl with different props in various expressions emphasising the self-identity of women.Artist Deepmala Maharjan’s set of artworks created in collaboration with her mother is simple, subtle yet heart-touching which shows the warmth of a mother and the relationship between a mother and her child.She has shown a phase of a mother from her pregnancy to her child being an adult. She has used the contrast of dark and light hues in her painting such as yellow, green, blue, black, white, purple and more. These human figures do not have any facial features making it apt for the Maulik exhibition visitors to relate to them with their own bond with their mothers as a child.Expression of different emotions Moreover, her works have shown an upgrade having more maturity in the execution and style than her previous works. She has recently become a mother herself and including her own mother in the art process through knitting has helped the viewers see her expressions as well as a message that anyone with a little bit of craft can be an artist.About the paintings, her mother Heera Maharjan shares, “I am really happy about the Maulik exhibition and I used to knit sweaters with different patterns, but I had never thought it can be turned into such a beautiful piece of artwork.”Likewise, similar tones of colours can be found in Singh’s paintings with the themes of love for humankind and nature where her paintings have depth in them while using motifs from Mithila art.

731,"‘ASEAN must boost links with China, India",Routine of Nepal banda,"Southeast Asia’s prosperity could hinge on supplying goods to China and India and luring investments from them, instead competing with economic giants in Western markets, a top international development expert said on Friday.China will likely become the world’s biggest economy  2025, while India might eclipse the US economy  the middle of this century, said Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the U.N. Millennium Project.Any effort  the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations to challenge the two powerhouses won’t bear much fruit, Sachs told reporters.“The idea of ASEAN as an exclusive trade unit to somehow give protection (against) China and India is probably not in the cards,” he said. “I wouldn’t see a defensive union make any sense.” ASEAN has expressed hopes of creating an ASEAN Economic Community  2020, which some officials say could help the region avoid being dwarfed economically  China and India.Several countries are calling for the plan - which would facilitate a free flow of products, services and human resources across the region - to be brought forward to 2015.A wide economic gulf divides ASEAN’s six more developed nations - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - and its four newer members - Cambodia, communist Vietnam and Laos and military-ruled Myanmar.",0

734,Asean ministerial meet: Eyeing a single market  2015,Routine of Nepal banda,"Southeast Asian trade ministers began a meeting on Monday to brainstorm ways to speed up economic integration and turn the region into a single market  2015, five years earlier than planned.Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, will explore the possibility of pushing forward the creation of an ASEAN Economic Community, or AEC, during their two-day retreat. Originally, members proposed it be completed  2020.Under the proposal, the AEC will allow the free flow of goods, services and people across the region that will boost trade and investment. The plans do not call for a single currency.The ministers will assess progress of ASEAN’s various free trade negotiations and are to meet South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong and European Union trade chief Peter Mandelson on Tuesday.“The ministers will be addressing many of the issues that led to the perception that we are not moving in terms of economic integration,” ASEAN Secretary General Ong Keng Yong told reporters.“The idea is to see how we can operationalize many of the initiatives and schemes for economic integration. There is not enough momentum.” The proposal to accelerate the formation of the AEC was made  the bloc’s leaders at their summit in December.ASEAN nations have already lowered tariffs for most products among themselves under a regional free trade pact, but the pace of liberalization in services trade remains sluggish, and a number of non-tariff barriers are hindering growth in the region, which has a market of 530 million people but accounts for only 6 percent of global exports.Philippine Trade Secretary Peter Favila said they would evaluate recommendations from the ASEAN Secretariat to strengthen institutional arrangements and to shift from ASEAN’s policy of making decisions based on consensus to achieve the AEC.They will also evaluate proposals for “strong doses of liberalization and trade facilitation” for 11 priority sectors in goods and services, he said, without elaborating. Ministers from Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam could not attend the meeting due to other committments, officials said. The three countries are represented  senior officials.The other members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar and Singapore.The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the resort island of Boracay, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of Manila, but bad weather caused  tropical storm Chanchu, which has left at least 37 people dead, forced officials to shift the meeting to the Philippine capital.

735,EDCD to vaccinate stray dogs to control rabies,Routine of Nepal banda,"The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) under the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) is planning to introduce a Canine Control Programme to check rabies  vaccinating stray and community dogs.The programme will be piloted in two municipalities, Biratnagar and Janakpur, from March 14.Dr Manas Banerjee, senior health administrator at the EDCD said that since 80 per cent of the rabies cases are reported due to dog bite, the EDCD is introducing the programme. “The expansion of the programme will depend on the results from these two municipalities,” Dr Banarjee said.According to the programme, female dogs will be sterilised with help from various NGOs, along with vaccinating dogs, deworming them and tagging them so that it would be easy to find out whether the dog that bit a person was vaccinated or not. “Most of the children who die from rabies were not treated or did not receive adequate post-exposure treatment. Hence, if the main source could be vaccinated, deaths can be prevented,” Dr Banerjee said.According to the EDCD, 89.2 per cent of rabies are caused  dog bite, while the per centage of other animals causing the disease is very small. It is estimated that around 30,000 people take vaccination against rabies each year and around 50 people lost their lives due to the disease.EDCD has been providing 5 per cent Inactivated Anti- Rabies Vaccine to 60 health institutions throughout the country. According to the EDCD, 4232 people were administered the rabies vaccine in 2002.Research shows that mostly men are bit  dogs due to their nature of work. A total of 71 per cent male and 29 per cent female come for Post-exposure treatment, it shows. According to Dr Banerjee, the two municipalities are selected as the number of rabies cases is more compared to other places. “We have to activate the provision of vaccinating domestic dogs and there should be a tag for every one of them as per the Municipality Act, 2020,” he said.",0
736,Commonsense pays,Routine of Nepal banda,"Nearly after 30 years, the Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee (KVTDC) is upgrading the land use map of the valley with the intent to control haphazard urbanisation. The new map would evaluate the changes in land use that have taken place since 1976, the year when Kathmandu Valley Land Use Plan was first enforced, and incorporate the changes in accordance with the Land Use Plan 2020. For this, the KVTDC along with five municipalities have to raise Rs 2.5 million to cover the core areas, whereas a sum of Rs 10 million is ostensibly required for the review of the entire valley. Even if it incorporates only the core areas of the valley, enforcement of the laws would go a long way towards regulating and controlling land abuse.Such a step on the part of the agency concerned was long overdue since the capital is fast turning into a major slum valley, thanks to rapid and unchecked urbanisation. Official indifference, corruption and rising number of litigation cases have been mainly responsible for this state of affairs. In a sense, the KVTDC is already late in initiating the review, as the natural beauty of the valley has long been damaged due to unplanned constructions. Nevertheless, at least for the new areas coming up in the valley’s periphery, being developed especially for the migrant population, a systematic plan with long-lasting infrastructure should be designed. Such a plan would not only make the city look cleaner and beautiful, but would also help in saving valuable resources. In turn, a good system can have multiple effects on the development process of the country, helping greatly in building a sustainable society. Towards this end, it would be prudent to draw lessons from the neighbouring countries like India where the Supreme Court recently gave order for demolition of illegally constructed buildings. The state must not hesitate to take decisive actions that are in the long-term, overall interest of the society.

737,Efforts on to amend building -laws,Routine of Nepal banda,"The Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee along with the five municipalities of the Valley and the three District Development Committees is working to draft an amendment to the building -laws that were introduced 12 years ago.Devendra Dongol, head of the Urban Development Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, said the initiation was taken with a view to controlling haphazard urbanisation in the Valley. “The existing building -laws have been outdated and cannot address the need of the fast-growing city.”Member secretary of the town development committee, Indra Bahadur Shrestha said the committee has allocated Rs 800,000 for the preparation of the revised land-use map of the Valley. The existing land-use map was prepared 20 years ago. “We have decided to authorise Rural Urban Planners’ Society of Nepal to prepare a revised map,” he said.Besides the local bodies concerned — including the committee and the DDCs — are scheduled for to meet on Tuesday for the second time to discuss on efforts to introduce multi-storied flat system of housing outside the Ring Road.Dongol said the government should plan and build large buildings for low and middle-income people living in the Valley.He added that the KMC has already sent proposals to different donor agencies for the systematic urban development of the Valley.“There is no alternative but to introduce flat system if we really want to develop our city where 5,000 houses are built every year in a haphazard way,” he said.Admitting that the KMC could not monitor the haphazard construction within the metropolis due to various reasons, he said it has already been too late to plan for the overall development of the City.Due to reasons like conflict and Valley-centered markets, construction of buildings even on very small plots has increased during the last seven years.“Though the private companies have already introduced the flat system, their service is limited to higher income groups and is profit oriented,” he said.The amendment of the -laws intends to address the changes in the land-use pattern after 1976 when the government adopted and enforced the Kathmandu Valley Land Use Plan.It will also help incorporate land use changes in the updated map in accordance with the land use strategy adopted  the Plan 2020. It will help prepare digitised land use maps, which can be effectively used for regulating the land use pattern and enforcement of the physical planning and building -laws.

738,Govt to expand Filariasis control programme,Routine of Nepal banda,"The government is expanding the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) in six additional districts next year with a view to eliminating the disease from the country 2020. The six districts where the plan will be launched are Kapilvastu, Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Dhadhing and Nuwakot. “The programme will gain speed from next year as LF has to be eliminated from the country,” Dr Shankher Bahadur Shrestha, senior medical officer at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) told this daily. Dr Shrestha said the elimination of the disease has taken a back seat as the government has been giving priority to those diseases that cause morbidity and high mortality rate.“Moreover, due to budget constraints, the programme has not gained momentum,” he said.All people above two years have been administered the drug in the affected areas for a period of five years. “Earlier, it was difficult to take blood from patients only between 10 pm to 2 am. But now, the tests can be done with ease with a new methodology,” he said. The programme was first launched in Parsa district in 2003 and it covered 5 lakh of the population.It was later taken to two more districts - Makwanpur and Chitwan - in 2004 and Nawalparasi and Rupendhehi in 2005. The programme has covered 3 million people living in five districts. The country initiated the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) under a programme to eliminate LF as a public health problem within 2020.As per the plan, at least two drug regimens - Albendazole plus Diethylcarbazaine (DEC) — have to be administered once a year for a period of five years to check the transmission. Dr Shrestha said the Department of Health Services has trained 12,000 village health workers for the programme. The total population covered in the three districts, including Parsa, was 15,41,200. Of the 14,51,899 eligible people, 12,58,113 were given the anti-filarial drugs, ie 86.65 per cent of the targeted people. According to the ‘Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination programme in Nepal 2004,’ epidemiological sample survey carried out in 37 districts in 2001  Immuno Chroma Tography (ICT) card test method revealed that 50 out of the 75 districts in the country have been identified as endemic to LF. Out of the 25 remaining districts, 13 hilly districts are doubtful, hence surveillance needs to be done. The remaining 12 districts are mountainous districts which are considered to be non-endemic.

The petitioner also said that due to caste-based discrimination the lower caste people are facing problems, to the extent that they find it difficult to even get lodgings on rent in cities. “The so-called upper class people still do not want to let out lodgings to the lower caste people. There is an urgent need to promulgate a law to make such things punishable,” he added.The petitioner said local authorities, including District Development Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committees should have the power to monitor such behaviour if people commit such social crimes.According to the petitioner, due to lack of legal provisions lower caste people are deprived of rights guaranteed  Articles 11(3), (4) 12, 23 and 88 of the Constitution.

740,Govt to launch programmes against blindness in rural areas,Routine of Nepal banda,"The government is planning to launch massive curative and preventive services for blindness among people in rural areas. Researches say about 80 per cent of the total cases of blindness in Nepal is curable if treated in time. Neekshya SJB Rana, assistant minister for Health and Population today said eye sight is everybody’s right and therefore the government and various non government organisations are planning to provide curative and preventive services related with blindness in the rural areas. “Ninety-two per cent of the blind people live in rural areas and researches have proved that more than 80 per cent of the blindness can be prevented if treated in time,” said Rana.“The government is organising various awareness programmes regarding prevention of blindness and will seek medical help on World Sight Day on October 13,” said Rana. Nepal Blindness Survey 1981 revealed that 0.84 per cent of total population are blind on both eyes and 1.7 per cent in one eye. “It is sad that most of the people still take blindness as a curse and hide it due to fear of being stigmatised, hence the communities, health workers and civil society should disseminate information on the causes of blindness and encourage them to go to health centres to treat eye ailments,” said Rana. At present, there are 18 eye hospitals and over 28 primary eye care centres in various places in Nepal. Nepal with the help of WHO in collaboration with international non government organisations had launched “Vision 2020-The right to sight” in 1999 with a view to eliminating avoidable blindness through mobilisation of additional resources. The NB survey shows that 180 million people in the world have visual disability. Nine out of ten who are blind live in developing countries like Nepal. In general, 80 per cent of this blindness is avoidable, that is either preventable (such as trachoma and xerophthalmia) or curable (such as cataract).

742,Patients head abroad despite facilities here,Routine of Nepal banda,"Lack of referral facilities to the cancer hospitals  major hospitals of the country has resulted in cancer patients going to India and abroad. This, while hospitals in the country can well provide quality service. Mahendra Bahadur Karki, president of the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital (BPKMCH) said major hospitals should refer patients to Bhaktapur Cancer hospital or BPKMCH, and be unmindful of commercial concerns. “The majority of the cases have been referred to the Indian hospitals and to those in other countries even though the service provided  BPKMCH is par excellence,” said Karki during a press conference here. “The referral  major hospitals is nearly nil while some Indian hospitals refer patients to BPKMCH,”said Karki. “Service charges are very reasonable there.”A current estimate  the World Health Organisation (WHO) showed that around 45,000 people are suffering from cancer in Nepal. In addition, each year 27,000 new cases are cropping sup. “BPKHMC is coping with around 90 per cent of surgical cases and 99 per cent of the radiotherapy, which is of international standards,” said Dr Bal Man Singh Karki, executive director at BPKMCH. Dr Karki said cancer can be cured if it is detected timely and that it can be prevented as well. “Around 90 per cent of cancers are caused  exogenous factors such as tobacco, alcohol, dietary factors, salt, smoked and nitrated foods. High-fat diets cause an increased risk of breast cancer, and so do the occupational exposures and virus,” said DrKarki. “At least 30 per cent of cancers can be prevented if tobacco consumption is controlled.”According to WHO estimates, there will be 9.3 million new cases in the third world countries, with 6.3 million deaths  2020. A total of 10 million new cases and 6 million deaths  cancerhave occurred in 2000 throughout the world. Cases of cancer in Nepal mostly comprise lung, bronchial, uterine cervix and breast.Dr Karki said around 2000-5000 women would be screened for Human Papillona Virus shortly and if checked in time, around 15 per cent of the infectious cancer could be controlled. To generate awareness about cancer, the Health Ministry and BPKMCH are celebrating “First National Cancer Awareness day” on September 26  organising rallies in Chitwan. The BPKMCH has 55,000 patients in the out-patient department and 3,000 in the in-patient, with 3 to 5 per cent mortality.

743,40 lakh people suffering from heart disease,Routine of Nepal banda,"Around 15 per cent of the total population of the country, numbering about 40 lakh, is suffering from heart disease, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). It is also estimated that hundreds of thousands people have died due to the disease. WHO also said that heart disease would be the number one killer disease  2020 in developing countries.“On one hand, there is an increasing unhealthy lifestyle, eating habits, unbalanced diets.

745,Citizenship law discriminatory against women,Routine of Nepal banda,"Discriminatory legal system which denies issuance of citizenship to children on the basis of mother’s citizenship has deprived hundreds of thousands of Nepalis of their citizenship certificates. “Citizenship is the fundamental right of every human being,” said Sapana Pradhan Malla, president of Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD). “A mother gives birth to children, but depriving women of acquiring their children’s citizenships on the basis of their citizenships is violation of human rights,” she said. According to a recent survey conducted  FWLD in three districts regarding the citizenship, 43.75 per cent have been facing problems due to administrative and procedural hassles. Tulasa Lata Amatya, president of Community Action Care-Nepal, has been fighting to get her citizenship to her daughters from the past nine years. “We have been living here for the past 24 years but the state has denied citizenship certificates for my children because I am married to a Dutch,” she said. She said her nine-year-long struggle to get the citizenship issued has not helped.The 2047 Constitution and the Nepal Citizenship Act-2020 have provisions, among others, of issuing the citizenship to those whose father is a Nepali, but the Nepal Citizenship Act-2009 and Constitution 2019 had provisions of issuing citizenship to a child born either to a Nepali father or a Nepali mother. However, the issue of not getting citizenship on the basis of a Nepali mother’s citizenship is not only the one problem associated with women. Actress Mausami Malla wants to get her citizenship amended  removing the name of her former husband. “We have been divorced for a long time, but my citizenship still has his name as my husband because my citizenship was issued on the basis of his citizenship,” she said. “The solution to problems like these lies in the amendment of the Constitution, but the complications can be reduced at the administrative level,” Malla said. “The government is well aware of the problems regarding the citizenship issue and is positive towards solving them,” said Shyam Sundar Sharma, spokesperson of the ministry.

747,How tourism can change Nepal,Routine of Nepal banda,"It will only be tautological to say that Nepal has not been able to make desirable headway towards development despite five decades of planned development. Thailand and South Korea were in a similar phase of development back in the fifties. In the new millennium, Nepal finds itself lagging streets behind them. South Korea in particular has been an example to emulate for the developing countries round the globe.What are the reasons for this state of affairs? Dor Bahadur Bista in his book entitled Fatalism and Development attributed it to the fatalism prevalent in our society. But the most important factor is certainly the lack of vision necessary for development.Abdul Kalam, the president of India, in his book entitled India: 2020, writes that vision should appear non-attainable at first glance but should be achievable once the heart and soul is put into it. India has a vision of being transformed into a developed nation for which it is seeking to attain a per capita income of $1538  2020 from the present $440.Countries round the globe fall under three categories—underdeveloped, developing and developed. The ultimate vision of any country is certainly the attainment of a developed status within a fixed period of time. Countries should identify their core competence areas in which they are strong and mobilise it for development. India has taken technology as its core competence. In Nepal, tourism and hydropower are widely recognised as two of the core competences.Of these two, tourism could be a better option because of its soft feature compared to hydropower, which is of a hard nature. For the development of hydropower, it has to be sold to India and an approach has to be made to donors for financing. But in the case of tourism, it is possible with private sector investment.Nepal has a per capita of $244 at present and it can be increased to $767 after forty-two years if it can achieve a growth rate of 5 per cent every year  restraining the population growth to 2 per cent. With 7, 8, 9 and 10 per cent national growth the per capita can jump to $1760, $2650, $3976 and $5942. The achievement, which India is seeking to make  2020, Nepal can make  2045 if it can generate a sustained growth rate of about 6.5 per cent a year.The Ninth Five Year Plan had made a projection of 6 per cent growth but it slumped down to 3.6 per cent at the end. There have been several factors for this but the lack of investment has been pointed out as one of the most determining ones. The plan aimed to make an investment of Rs.370 billion but ended up financing only $310 billion. It is thus clear that an added investment of about 12 billion per year is enough to achieve a growth rate of 6 per cent.The income from tourism is $400 per person at present takes an average stay period of ten days. If we can attract five lakh tourists from China in addition to about 4 lakh we get every year, less than 0.6 per cent of what China gets every year (86 million) the gap of more than 12 billion rupees can be filled up. With this the growth rate of 6 to 6.5 per cent can be achieved.It may sound little discouraging to wait for four decades when our southern neighbor is attaining this status in two decades. But what we have to realise is that we have been far behind India in the race towards developmental goal.

749,319 undergo cataract surgery,Routine of Nepal banda,"Three hundred nineteen cataract patients, most of them from poor financial background, had their eyes operated upon at a four-day eye camp organised at the Pullahari Monastery in Kapan.The Micro-Surgical Sight Restoration Workshop was jointly organised  Tilganga Eye Centre, Ananda Sangh and Pullahari Monastery with support from Nepal Scouts and the Rotary Club of Swoyambu. The patients were chosen after examining their eyesight at camps held in Kavre, Bhaktapur, Dhading, Nuwakot and Lalitpur at different times. Patients from Manang, Dolpa and Solukhumbu districts, too, listed their names for the operation that started on April 6.The patients, who could neither afford medical expenses nor have access to good ophthalmic surgery in their districts, benefited from the camp. It costs around Rs 10,000 for a cataract surgery. Bhairav Bahadur Gurung, 76, of Solukhumbu, who had his right eye operated, said: “What can be more beautiful than receiving an eyesight free of cost.” Chetrakumari Bista, 64, a resident of Machhegaun, said she could get her eyesight restored because of the free surgery, as she was not able to pay for the same. Senior surgeons Dr Sanduk Ruit, Dr Reeta Gurung, Dr David Chang and Dr Geoff Tabin conducted the surgery.Dr Ruit said Nepal is ahead in providing eye care to the people. “It has better manpower and infrastructure for eye care compared to other South Asian countries, but there is no proportional distribution of the service. The monastery provided food and lodging to the patients for free while monks and 27 scout volunteers looked after the patients.The Tilganga Eye Centre conducts 5000 cataract surgeries a year and about 300,000 people are suffering from the ailment. Tilganga’s surgeons have conducted a total of 76 eye camps, examining around 80,000 patients and performing 17,500 cataract surgeries since 1994. Nepal aims to eradicate preventable blindness  2020.

Dr Zaman emphasised that the population of ageing was an issue that needed attention not just in South Asia but all over the world. Global concern for the elderly was raised in the First World Assembly on Ageing at Vienna in 1982 followed  several national and international conferences including the Second World Assembly on Ageing at Madrid in 2002.It projected that  the year 2020, there would be twice as many people over 60 in the less developed regions compared to the developed world with Asia containing over 80 per cent of the estimated 700 million elderly people in the developing world.This book focuses on this issue in India but covers certain issues and concerns significant for all of South Asia. The authors have used the voices of the older people, government officials, United Nations representatives, voluntary sector workers and a whole range of statistics as a part of research, projections from census and other data sources to provide an insight to the experience of growing old in a country with an increasing ageing population, limited social security benefits and changing social structure.The book has many firsts, claimed Shankhardass, “It brings together various disciplines and thoughts.” The authors have dealt with the issue from various points of view ranging from demographic, sociological, gerontological to policy analyses.”UNFPA provided financial support for conducting of this research in India for this book. Published  BR Publishing Corporation, New Delhi, India, the authors stated that this work was one of a kind. “The index that I developed is of particular interest,” said Ashish Bose, co-author.“It has a ‘How Fit’ and health which is the single most important problem confronted  the elderly. IT also has a transcendental index. Emotional poverty creates mental distress. The world in the 21st Century is dominated  old people. To keep fit one must practice yoga and meditation. It is the low-cost most effective method against ageing and it can’t be done in old age.”

754,Healthy heart,Routine of Nepal banda,"Cardiovascular diseases are an emerging health problem in much of South Asia. One to two per 1,000 children in Nepal suffer from rheumatic heart disease, while some five per cent of adult population in Kathmandu suffer from coronary artery disease. Realising the need to exchange ideas for the prevention, cure and new techniques of treatment, some 500 delegates from around the globe have gathered in Kathmandu to organise the third biennial South Asian conference on cardiology beginning Friday. Responsible for over 30 per cent of all deaths worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are now a global health menace. According to one estimate, heart attacks will be the leading cause of death worldwide  2020.Transformation in lifestyle from an active one to sedentary coupled with the change in dietary habits have been diagnosed the leading cause of the rise in the number of cardiac ailments. Consumption of high-calorie fast foods, with high quantities of harmful cholesterol, has been one of the primary causes of the rise in cardiac diseases. South Asian dishes are also rich in fat and salt content. Most of the calories are converted to fatty acids and with age begin depositing on arteries. Over time, the deposits clog arteries, reducing blood flow often leading to heart attacks or strokes. Unhealthy food, rich in fat content, give rise to obesity, a condition of being disproportionately fat. Such people run a higher risk of high blood pressure and are predisposed to cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, evidence shows smoking and drinking worsen the ailment.The participants in the conference will do well  focusing on promoting greater awareness on good food and healthy life style as preventive measures to fight the heart ailments. Mother nature has a lot to offer in terms of healthy food free from fat or high cholesterol. This, combined with a moderate physical exercises to burn off extra calories, will help reduce fat deposition in the human body. The benefits of consuming fruits, fibres and vegetables cannot be overemphasised. Couch potatoes need to move around and consider the disadvantages of consuming ready-to-eat food packages, that have more of the harmful edible components. Medical check ups and assessing the Body Fat Index, a scientific way of knowing body fat content, would be a handy tool to keep a vigil over rise in body fat. Prevention is the best tool to fight the disease. This does not mean that this is adequate. Research in treatment must continue as people suffer from the ailment even if they combine healthy food with regular exercise. But a lot could be achieved  sending across the message that prevention is better than cure.

758,"Privatisation should promote services, say experts",Routine of Nepal banda,"A two-day programme on ‘Restructuring and Privatisation in Nepal: Developing Union Strategies for Industrial Policy’ kicked off here on Tuesday.Privatisation can take different forms in different sectors or countries. After a decade of slow and low level of privatisation of Nepal’s electricity sector, the forms of privatisations that exist currently are leasing out of Nepal Electricity Authority run small hydropower plants, joint ventures with public and private sectors and private sector participation to develop power projects in the country.Due to these privatisations, the workers fear job security, have increased incidents of harassment  management, reduction in social security and job losses of mainly middle level workers.“We as unions have to understand and respond to privatisation not simply as an ideological issue but also from the perspective of the changes that will take place at work and amongst our members,” said Dr Govind Nepal, consultant at General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT) giving his presentation. “The key issues such as information and monitoring of privatisation, securing a union voice, forming coalition with other unions and making operating system more people friendly needs to be addressed.”Current estimates  the United Nations suggest that around one-third of the world’s population do not have access to electricity-some two billion people are still dependent on open fires for cooking their food.“Energy is a basic social need that is essential to promote and improve quality of life, but corporations have translated it into a commodity, which like everything else must be produced and traded for maximum profit,” said Gino Govindar, energy officer at ICEM-Brussels, giving his presentation titled ‘Global Trends in the Energy Industries’.“The two billion people who still do not have access to the modern energy in any form will remain marginalised if energy policy continues to be driven  profit motive.”The latest forecasts  the International Energy Association suggest that the world population will grow from six billion at the end of 20th century to around eight billion in 2020.It is estimated that 90 per cent of the projected increase will take place in developing world, with some 85 per cent of global population living in these countries and be responsible for approximately 55 per cent of the world’s energy consumption.Ideally this world energy outlook augurs well for the future of energy workers at a global level, providing the catalysts for socially sustainable economic development and the job creation opportunities this brings for workers.“Whilst, the current trends indicate that traditional energy jobs are shrinking and sub-contracted, non-unionised and unprotected jobs are on the rise placing an enormous responsibilities on our affiliates to not only shaping future energy demand and supply but also ensuring that good jobs are created in the process of development,” said Govindar.In the face of global energy revolution, with its priorities such as democratic basis for national choice and that unions must be involved and consulted, ICEM’s approach is based on action for social energy.

759,settlers prefer valley outskirts,Routine of Nepal banda,"Pollution, crowds and concretisation are driving wealthy people out of the city to adjoining Village Development Committees (VDCs) in the Kathmandu valley. Permission to construct out of town is much simpler in the VDCs than within the confines of Kathmandu Metropolitan Corporation. At the same time, farming lands are constantly being squeezed  such haphazard and unmonitored construction.Officials are working on a plan to reserve some areas to cope with unplanned urban sprawl, said a source at Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee (KVTDC). ""A plan is in the offing to reserve nine village areas in long term preparation for a well managed expansion of towns in the Kathmandu valley,"" he said.The committee thinks that such a step will help a clear demarcation of rural and urban areas of the valley to emerge and also will conserve land for farming. ""This will further ensure the possibility of investment into service delivery systems like water, power and telephone,"" said the source, adding that the committee will prepare such infrastructures  2020.Initially, the committee has decided to reserve lands at Tusal in Kirtipur Municipality, Wards-4, 6 and 9 of Ichangu VDC, Manamaiju VDC, Nepaltar and Kapan VDC. A total of 247 hectares of land will be conserved as ‘green belt’ for farming,  preventing buying, selling or construction of any buildings in those designated areas.Similarly, 138 hectares will be booked in Nayapati and Gothatar VDCs and Kamal Binayak of Bhaktapur Municipality. Similarly, lands in Harisiddhi, Thaiba and Imadol will also be retained for future town planning.However, the prospect of the plan is not that advanced so far, said a town development official. Access from these areas to central Kathmandu is one of the vital factors for the implementation of the plan. Until the completion of the ‘not-yet-started’, but ‘much talked about’ external ring-road in the valley, these ‘future-towns’ will not have proper links to the city.The concept of an outer ring-road seems to be history, judging the manner in which its files are gathering dust in the concerned ministry’s folder. “The road plan has been defined only as an idea, nothing can happen unless the government itself initiates the plan,” the town planner explains.For a decade now, a large number of posh residential buildings have been built in these areas, followed  a hike in the price of land. Such new residences have also been pumping out a limitless amount of groundwater without any monitoring method or regulations. “If shifting from the city to VDCs goes on at this rate, without serious monitoring, the capital valley will have no land left for cultivation,” it said.",0

However, today, this might not be true as there are many examples of misinformation and media sensationalisation. The case is even the same in the history of media in Nepal also. To change the scenario, the country needs strict law and its effective implementation.The need for changeAs misinformation tarnishes the trust of the media and jeopardises all democratic institutions, the need of the hour is to encourage investigative journalism and fact-checking. There is a need to establish Nepali organisations that are committed to confirming the veracity of the news, such as verifying social media rumours, claims made  political parties or any biased information available across all the data sources. A few initiatives have been taken to set up artificial intelligence tools to assist in fact-checking and combatting fake news.Many reform-minded professionals are concerned about the media’s lack of trust, both in the public and commercial sectors. Despite some development, Nepali journalists are still unfamiliar with the standards of ethical journalism. Though there have been no major incidents with regards to press freedom violations, at the same time, no improvement has been seen in Nepal’s journalism. Out of most of the freedom violations recorded  the Federation of Nepali Journalists, most of the cases were due to journalists disregarding their professional code of conduct.The way forward is to implement strict laws with regards to reporting of wrong information  news channels, especially social media platforms. Also, information literacy among people is important with the emergence of online media so that they are more aware of everything. Last but not the least, Nepali journalists must strive to follow their professional code of conduct and try and increase the ranking of Nepal in the Press Freedom Index to decrease the influence and power of political parties over the media and information.

First, Balen is going to make a statue of rap singer Yamabuddha. The corporation has allocated.According to KMC sources, around Rs 1.5 million has been allocated for the construction of the statue. According to the secretariat of the mayor of the metropolis, Balen Sah, the statue of Yamuddha is being constructed in appreciation of the contribution made  the hip-hop and knap-hop genre.Mayor Bale's personal secretary Bhupdev Shah said that the decision was taken in appreciation of the contribution made  Rapper Yambuddha in introducing 'Nephup' to the world. ""The mayor himself is a rap singer of this genre,"" he said ""Many rappers of the Nepali youth consider Yamabuddha as their idol. Many listeners respect him, so the metropolis has decided to make a statue in his honor.""Balen's own staunch supporters are now protesting against the decision to make the statue. Meanwhile, a video of Balen being missed at a public event has gone viral. Sah was the chief guest at the grand finale of the rap reality show 'Nephp's Shripech' last Saturday. He is also a judge of the reality show.Balen's body language seemed a bit unnatural as he stood on stage several times in the final. In any public event or interview, Balen tends to be polite and disciplined. He never seems to behave indecently or impulsively.In this program, he looked a bit unstable and restless. Once, while the announcer was speaking, Balen suddenly appeared in front of him and tried to pull the mic. After the announcer said something, he backed away and stood in his signature pose with both hands in front of him. Also, he seemed to be hugging and whispering to anyone. There have been various comments on Balen's presentation. During the live broadcast of the program, there were a lot of comments saying 'Mayor Zyapama'.Since Balen is also a common man, he should not care about his private life apart from office hours, but Balen is being criticized for how relevant it is for a person with a public image to be forgotten in a public event. These two steps have pushed the graph of Balen's popularity downhill.

It says it has no way out when it comes to controlling it.",0
771,'No policy allows businesses to run on footpath',Setopati,"Kathmandu Metropolitan City has clarified that it does not have the policy of allowing the operation of any sort of business on the footpath.The KMC policy states that no goods and commodities, including foodstuff, can be sold and distributed from the roadside or on the footpath at any time. Talking to the RSS, KMC Police Chief Dhanapati Sapkota said footpath management was one of the prime responsibilities given  the KMC to the Metropolitan Police.""The pavement is for pedestrians. It is not made for running shops and stalls. Those operating shops and stalls without obeying this rule have been hauled and their goods confiscated,"" KMC Police Chief said, reminding that newly-elected Mayor Balendra Shah had announced that businesses run on the footpath during the time of filing his candidacy would be managed.Shah was elected KMC mayor through the municipal election held a couple of months ago. It is also stated in the Policy and Programmes for the next fiscal year passed  the KMC municipal assembly on June 22 that businesses operating on the footpath would be controlled.""We have moved forward the work as per the decision of the KMC Executive. There's no reason to protest regarding the matter. What's the point in protesting when we have carried out our job in line with the Municipal Executive's decision? It is also our responsibility to transform the business operated on the footpath so that they come under the ambit of tax,"" Sapkota elaborated.Stating that it was natural to deal with criticisms while carrying out works, he said the KMC had only been controlling encroachment on the roads and pavements. ""Business operated on the pavement or roads will be affected when the authorities try to control encroachment,"" he said. The KMC Police Chief said he had taken such comments and criticisms as obvious.He insisted that the work on footpath management had been expedited as per the interest of the general public. Sapkota said, ""Running a business using the street is not positive in any sense. The policy of the KMC mentions that no one is allowed to run business in the street round-theclock and if it has been taking place somewhere, it is being operated clandestinely. KMC will take initiative to bring all of them under the ambit of law in the coming days.""""The city police has been focusing on bringing the vendors under control in the morning and evening when the movement of people is high,"" he opined. The KMC faced mounting criticism after a video of the city police confiscating good from a couple selling maize on the street and misbehaving with the couple was uploaded on social media.The KMC has been working to control street encroachment  deploying four teams on a daily basis. Mostly, the streets of Sundhara, New Road, Baneshwor, Koteshwor, Gaushala, Chabahil, New Bus Park, Balaju, Kalanki and Kalimati are being encroached.""The KMC was compelled to take such action after its frequent requests not to run any business encroaching the street were ignored,"" Sapkota argued. According to the KMC, goods confiscated from the vendors are put up for auction.Similarly, goods that become stale easily as well as fruits, vegetables and flammable substances are returned to the concerned businessman after taking fine from them.In the current fiscal year, the local government has proceeded with the sale of confiscated goods at an auction and in the previous fiscal year, goods including iron items, hoarding boards, bicycles and carts worth Rs 5.2 million were sold at an auction, he said.",0

Dahal proposed the names of politburo and standing committee members. All top leaders -- Dahal, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Dev Prasad Gurung, Janardan Sharma, Barshaman Pun, and Haribol Gajurel -- are members of the politburo and the standing committee.Initially, Dahal had proposed 125-member politburo, but as some CC members raised objections, saying the party chair nominated politburo members without following any criteria, Dahal added 31 alternative members to the politburo.Narayan Kaji Shrestha said there was confusion about the names of politburo members as Dahal mistakenly read out the names from a raw draft. Shrestha said the CC meeting had finalised 15 members of the standing committee and would name the remaining 26 members soon.CPN-MC leader Giriraj Mani Pokharel said Dahal added names after some leaders pointed out that senior leaders and leaders from provinces were not included in the politburo.Asked if Dahal used his own discretion to name members in the politburo and the standing committee, Pokharel said Dahal had the party leaders' faith and had named members of party bodies in accordance with the party's eighth general convention. ""We had elected party leaders in the general convention on the basis of consensus. This time too we have selected members of top bodies of the party on the basis of consensus,"" he said.He said the party would soon name office bearers as well.Dahal announced in the CC meeting today that Narayan Kaji Shrestha would be the senior vice-chair of the party.A version of this article appears in the print on July 8, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.

776,Joshi's Hiti Pranali launched,Shranup Tandukar,"Hiti Pranali, a book about the ancient water system of the Valley, was launched amidst an event held in the Capital on July 6. Civil engineer Padma Sundar Joshi has penned the book which talks about efficiency and revival of the ancient hiti (stone water tap) system in the Valley.Hitis have been around in the Valley since the Lichchhavi period. Three big rajkulo (state water systems) - that begin from Budhanilkantha in Kathmandu, Tika Bhairav in Lalitpur, and Bageshwori in Bhaktapur - as well as smaller water systems are a part of the Valley's water system, informed Joshi at the event.He also shared that the water system here is powered  underground water reservoir, ponds, and monsoon rain.The earliest written mention of hiti is in the Sinagu Vihara of Swayambhu, which states that the Lichchhavi king Brisasdev was the one to establish this water system, he informed.Joshi's book details the aforementioned things along with the technical workings of ancient hitis, their conservation, and the social customs that revolve around them.The author also mentioned short snippets of these topics during the event.""One particular incident that I remember is when I got sick and my mother took me to a faith healer,"" he said. ""He told my mother: 'naag dosh cha naag lai puja garde' (he has been cursed  snake god and you should do an appeasement ceremony). So, I cleaned water spouts as a part of the ceremony. I don't know if this act cured me but this established fear of offending the snake gods prevented people from polluting their water sources and possibly preventing the culmination of water-borne diseases,"" Joshi shared.He added that hitis are centuries old but possess elements of modern engineering.""Our efforts should go into reviving such aspects of history and bring them together with modern concepts,"" Joshi said.Chiri Babu Maharjan, Mayor of Lalitpur Metropolitan City (LMC), shared the efforts of government to revive hitis at the event while informing, ""There is a huge pond inside Central Zoo, which is also the source of water for the stone taps in Dhobighat - Iku Hiti and Hiku Hiti. And because the pond in the zoo is well-maintained, these two stone taps never run out of water. It is proof that managing water sources in Lalitpur could also revive the stone taps in the City.""Meanwhile, sharing more about his book, Joshi informed that he has refrained from using complex words in Hiti Pranali so that it is understandable for everyone.""It is important to share this knowledge,"" he said. ""The more we talk about these hitis, the more we can conserve and revive them.""Hiti Pranali is published  Publication Nepalaya and is available for sale in major bookshops in the city.",0

Revolving fund accounts have been opened in 25 BFIs, fixed deposit accounts in 11 BFIs, savings accounts in 99 BFIs for the purpose of depositing the amount.""Despite the fact that depositing the amount in a bank that provides the highest interest rate in revolving fund account, savings account and other accounts will benefit the PADT, the governing body of Pashupatinath temple does not seem to be paying attention to it.Therefore, it will be reasonable for the PADT to deposit the amount in a commercial bank that offers the highest interest in various accounts through bidding  publishing a public notice,"" the report suggests.Even the annual report (2020-2021) of the Office of the Auditor General had suggested the PADT to deposit its amount in a bank that provides the highest interest rate. The Policies and Programmes (2019-2020) of the Government of Nepal had said the amount of the PADT would be deposited in the banks so as to earn maximum interest.""Instead of soliciting proposals from commercial banks  publishing a public notice, the PADT seems to be directly opening various accounts in BFIs on its own without negotiation.

786,Agro-forestry in Nepal: Multiple benefits,Srizu Bajracharya,"The agro-forestry system provides solutions to increased demand for forest resources, there reducing pressure on degraded forests of Nepal (for example, in the Terai and Inner Terai) where forest protection is of utmost importanceBurgeoning climate change (CC), population growth, inaccessible and degrading forests and lands, high demand and costly management of forest products have precipitated interest in Agro Forestry (AF). Unlike other forest system, Agro Forestry (AF) has the potentiality to address various on-farm adaptation needs, to fulfil myriad roles in agriculture, forestry, and land use related mitigation pathways.AF system incorporates the integration, in space or time, of woody perennials with herbaceous crops and/or animals on the same land management unit.AF system helps in rehabilitation of waste land i.e. it can easily regenerate in landslide damaged sites. This system ensures success of plant growth as it incorporates the planting of multipurpose trees that are fast growing and easy to propagate.There is year round distribution of employment, increased rainfall utilization, assistance in pest management and disease resistance.AF provides connectivity through corridors between habitats, preserves sensitive species, and buffers climatic changes that affect crop growth.The plantation of broom grass, along with cinnamon and lemon to curb shifting cultivation  the Hariyo ban program (in Tanahu district) has helped to connect the corridor along the river bank linking the low lying Terai forests with that of the mid-hills and mountain forests of the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) and has provided additional benefit to prevent crowding from invasive species.AF improves soil properties facilitating tighter nutrient cycling preventing nutrient including re-occurrence of limiting nutrients, adding organic matter (o.m) and nitrogen fixation  leguminous plants.Moreover, some forms of AF system require low inputs that help sustainability of such growing practices. It incorporates high biodiversity resulting in ecosystem services.This system provides solution to conflicting objectives of forest protection and land management because it increases the carbon storage (about 3-4 times more than traditional treeless cropping systems due to increase in above and below ground biomass with indirect effects on carbon sequestration reducing harvesting pressure on forest area due to availability of land resources for cultivation) enhancing agricultural productivity.It helps in countering global warming and the risk of hunger  increasing the drought resistant trees and the subsequent production of agricultural and forest crops. It also aids in carbon storage in soil through accumulation in soil o.m.A study has revealed that this system has a high carbon sequestration potential on the long term not because it has a carbon density (compared to forests) but because a lot of land can potentially be turned into this system.AF system is being practiced in Kailali, Sunsari, Bara , Dhading , Nuwakot, Ilam, including the Himalayas Sagarmatha region and others as a climate smart agricultural practice under different AF projects.Forest development projects that include three districts Sarlahi, Mahottari and Rautahaut have practiced AF system in a very large scale.A five year (2013 - 2018) AF and Community Forest (CF) research project funded  The Australian Centre for International Agriculture (ACIAR) is being implemented in Kavre Palanchowk, Lamjung, Sindu Palchok and Kaski district.Prior to the 21st CC conference at Paris, a draft called Intentionally Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) was proposed illustrating the nationally climatic contributions to limit global warming to 2.7°C  2100.Nepal has already communicated the INDC proposed plan to the UNFCC (United Nation Fund for Climate Change) Secretariat in February 2016.As per the promise made in INDC to limit CC effect Nepal has made plans to promote afforestation in public and private land and has also announced a forest decade for 2014-2023, that aims at creating new forests and tree groves in areas where complete deforestation has occurred, including managing natural forests.However, the result also shows that the forest area of Terai occupies only 3.08% of the total land of Nepal and is degrading at the rate of 1.3% annually.Some studies reveal that some of the AF practice system raises the Greenhouse gases emission like shifting cultivation, pasture maintenance  burning and over fertilization.Likewise, plant competition, the shading effect on the yield production is its other drawback.It seems necessary to predict which tree and crop association and management practices are suitable for different places and implement strategic plan, programs with effective policies accordingly.Though having multitude benefits of this plantation system the initiative taken  Nepal government to develop it is low.However, AF is the most promising sustainable forest management system that helps in climatic adaptation and resilience through increased biomass production, maintenance of soil properties and biodiversity, there, conserving natural forest with the scaling of farm based forestry system.This system provides solutions to increased demand for forest resources, there reducing pressure on degraded forests of Nepal (for example, in the Terai and Inner Terai) where forest protection is of utmost importance, Thus, the country needs to scale up this system more effectively and widely.#Dhading #Climate change #Sunsari #Ilam #Kailali #Nuwakot #Bara #Kaski district #Annapurna Conservation Area #Agro-forestry #Australian Centre for International Agriculture #Intentionally Nationally Determined Contributions #United Nation Fund for Climate Change #Himalayas Sagarmatha region

794,Unity govt figures as major parties agenda,Tika R Pradhan,"Is consensus government needed to implement the constitution? If yes, is that possible? Or, can a majority government do it. These issues are being debated in the three major parties as there is one-and-a-half year time for holding elections for the federal Parliament as stipulated in the constitution.Election of local bodies and provincial parliament are also major tasks in the first stage of statute implementation.Leaders of Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and CPN Maoist Centre have underscored the need of consensus government to ensure the first phase of statute implementation. However, their propositions vary although they say consensus government will be a strong instrument for addressing national problems and ensuring formation of the new federal parliament  January 21, 2018, as mentioned in the new constitution.NC leader Ramesh Lekhak said consensus government was imperative for the first stage of constitution implementation. He sees three alternatives for consensus government:First, change of incumbent KP Sharma Oli-led government to form consensus government as it has failed to gain the confidence of disgruntled parties. Formation of unity government led  the CPNMC is one alternative, Lekhak said.Second, forming unity government led  a UML leader other than Oli is another alternative, according to Lekhak.Third, formation of consensus government under the leadership of the largest party, the Nepali Congress.Of the three alternatives, the third will be natural, practical and secure way of ensuring statute implementation within the stipulated time, Lekhak said. Firstly, it was possible to promulgate the constitution under the NC’s leadership. And, secondly, the NC is the largest party with a successful track record.The CPN-UML standing committee meeting last Saturday had concluded that the party would be ready for consensus government. However, it urged other parties to support the Oli-led government if unity government could not be formed.“During the constitution making process, the then UCPN-Maoist and Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic were in opposition, yet they collaborated in the constitution making process. Opposition parties, including the NC, can help the country  following the same model,” Gyawali had told after the SC meeting.CPNMC leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha said his party had been advocating a national consensus government for a long time and it had declined the NC’s offer to form a majority government under CPNMC’s leadership due to the same reason.Forging consensus according to the roadmap of national agendas is of prime importance, Shrestha said.“Consensus is necessary on five agendas — concluding the remaining task of the peace process, forging consensus with agitating Madhes-based and other parties, creating environment for elections  enacting laws, speeding up reconstruction works and normalising the relationship with India.Then, the issue of government leadership can be discussed,” he said.As the CPN MC is a major stakeholder in the peace process, implementation of the statute under its leadership will be the best option, he said.",0
795,Govt in no hurry to implement statute!,Tika R Pradhan,"The government and the parties don’t seem to be in any hurry to implement the new constitution, although they have only one and a half years to meet the constitution-imposed deadline to form a new federal parliament  21 January 2018.Enacting around 138 new laws and setting up administrative structures at federal, provincial and local levels and holding elections at all three levels on the basis of those new laws before the deadline are challenging tasks before the government and the parties. But major parties seem more concerned about power games, as the Nepali Congress and the CPN-Maoist Centre have been trying to change the government, while Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is trying to prolong his term.Many constitutional appointments are now stranded in the parliament due to the rift between ruling and opposition parties on the strength of the Parliamentary Hearing Special Committee.Holding of provincial elections is uncertain, as there is no sign of the issue of boundaries of federal units being resolved soon.Although the government has announced it will hold local bodies’ elections  November/December as per the old structure, NC, CPN-MC and agitating Madhes-based parties are against it and are pleading to hold the polls as per the new constitution.A commission formed to restructure the boundaries and structures of the local bodies is working with a mandate of completing its task  March 13.It needs to await the commission’s report if the polls are to be held as per the provisions of the new constitution.Clashes of interests among parties while passing laws in the Parliament may create further delay.“Normally, it takes around three months to pass a bill after it is introduced in the Parliament. Some bills related to constitution implementation will require people’s feedback and extensive discussion even outside the Parliament.So, if the constitutional deadline is to be met, the government must bring all related bills within the ongoing House session and the parties should come together to pass the bills,” said Bharat Raj Gautam, spokesperson for Legislature Parliament Secretariat.Besides, the Parliament has many other agendas, including passing its new regulations, holding discussion on the Appropriation Bill and passing the budget and 51 bills that are stranded at various stages within the Parliament, Gautam said.“The government has introduced some bills at the Parliament and is drafting many others  setting priority.Concerned ministries are drafting bills under their purview and they will be taken to the Parliament gradually,” said Dilli Raj Ghimire, spokesperson for the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs.“It needs to work with time-bound action plan to accomplish the task and meet the deadline. The bills can have a smooth passage if the government makes the opposition parties participate from the stage of drafting laws.However, the government is busy securing the PM’s position and safeguarding the ruling parties’ interests,” said NC Chief Whip Chin Kaji Shrestha.CPN-UML Chief Whip Bhanubhakta Dhakal, however, said, “I hope the leaders will come together despite their differences as they did in the past and will be able to resolve all the challenges in statute implementation.”

796,NC reminds PM Oli of risks of delaying statute implementation,TRN Online,"Senior leaders of the Nepali Congress today met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Baluwatar and expressed concern about the delay in implementation of the new constitution. Stating that taking decisions on issues related to statute implementation, including enactment of laws, is not regular executive work, the NC leaders urged the PM to take decisions  involving the NC and other opposition parties.The NC leaders led  Sher Bahadur Deuba sought to prepare and follow a time-bound plan to bring election related laws and proceed with work to set up elected bodies, including federal and provincial legislatures and local bodies, said NC leader Ramchandra Paudel after the meeting.NC leader Bimalendra Nidhi said the delegation told the PM that a new elected parliament had to be formed  21 January 2018 as stipulated in the new constitution.“Since many tasks have to be accomplished to meet the deadline and the government has not been sensitive towards that, we told the PM to proceed with the tasks  creating acceptable political environment,” Nidhi said.The PM was reminded that a number of laws should be enacted to set up federal, provincial and local-level structures as per the new statute and since it was not a regular task to be handled only  the law ministry, the government should make the NC and other opposition parties participate in the process of drafting the laws.All laws should be enacted in package and not separately, Nidhi said.NC leaders told the PM that though Sher Bahadur Deuba was vice-chairman of the advisory committee of the National Reconstruction Authority, he had not been informed about the NRA’s activities.“NGOs close to CPN-UML have been entrusted with reconstruction tasks worth billions of rupees. The authority has been made a forum for appointment of political cadres. We strongly objected against that,” Nidhi said.NC leaders objected to the PM’s intervention in parliamentary and judicial affairs. “The PM tried to make the Parliamentary Hearing Special Committee defunct and impose political appointments in the judiciary,” said Nidhi.The delegation urged the PM to control growing corruption, anarchy, crime, loot and the tendency to break laws  various actors and the government’s failure to curb the same, Nidhi said.The PM did not give a concrete answer on how to address NC’s concerns although he expressed commitment to involve the NC in drafting laws related to statute implementation, according to Nidhi.The PM said he would inform the NC about the NRA’s activities in future. He added that the disputed provisions of the parliament regulations would be settled through voting.CPN-UML leader Subas Chandra Nembang said, “PM Oli is committed to taking the main opposition together on implementing the constitution and continuing talks.” The discussions were mainly focused on constitution implementation,” said Nembang.

798,Nepal to double its tiger population  2018,TRN Online,"If everything goes fine, Nepal is poised to double its tiger population  2018, four years earlier than the targeted year 2022. As per The Global Tiger Recovery Plan, which was endorsed in the St Petersburg Declaration on Tiger conservation in 2010, Nepal committed to double its tiger population  2022 from 121 to more than 250.On the basis of potential areas (TX2 area) where wild tiger’s number could be doubled very soon, the government, conservationists and related agencies have expressed possibility of doubling the tiger population earlier than 2022.The government said that though it was too early to say whether Nepal would meet the target of doubling the tiger population  2018, it could meet the target earlier than 2022.“ prioritising TX2 areas we hope that  the next census in 2018, we will be able to count a total of at least 210 or more tigers,” said Maheshwor Dhakal, deputy director general at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation,”But the lack of scientific census methods and trans-boundary coordination among othersm are still hurdles to doubling the tiger numbers at the earliest.”According to World Wildlife Fund Nepal, a conservation partner of the Government of Nepal since 1967, Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, Banke National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve are the TX2 areas that have a chance to doubling the tiger count  2018.“If we maintain the current spirit of conservation throughout the tiger range areas, we will meet the tiger doubling target  2018,” Kanchan Thapa, tiger biologist at WWF Nepal told The Himalayan Times.“The conservation programmes are more focused on TX2 areas that could give double results earlier.” Among these TX2 areas, Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve increased its tigers to 17 in 2013 from eight in 2009 and Parsa Wildlife Reserve increased tigers to seven from four. Whereas being the youngest national park, Banke had a record of four tigers from its first tiger census as it was declared a national park in 2009.Altogether 198 tigers have been recorded through census in 2013, which was 63 per cent increment in comparison to the previous census of 2009. Besides those TX2 areas, Chitwan and Bardia national parks have a large number of tigers.There were 120 and 50 big cats respectively as per the tiger census of 2013.While the nation has been celebrating its zero poaching of rhinos for the past few years, 2015 was the worst year for tiger conservation when Nepal police seized more than one dozen tiger skins.But WWF Nepal has claimed that those hides were not identified as belonging to Nepal’s tigers.Madhav Khadka, wildlife trade monitoring manager at the WWF, said poaching of tigers in Nepal had been brought under control thanks to coordination among government and non- government agencies, and security bodies.“Strong determination in conservation and trans-boundary coordination with India has brought us a step nearer to doubling the tiger population  the next tiger census in 2018,” he said.On the basis of GTRP, Nepal had made the National Tiger Recovery Plan. Which had set the goal of increasing e tiger population up to 250 adult tigers  2022.Other targeted activities were to manage the Tarai Arc Landscape as a priority conservation landscape, controlling prey and tiger poaching, institutional strengthening and capacity building, tiger-human conflict and community engagement, scientific monitoring, research and surveys and trans-boundary management.Tigers are the largest species of cat and one of the most iconic animals on the planet. One hundred years ago, there were 100,000 wild tigers. the year 2010, as few as 3,200 wild tigers remained. It was a shocking 97 per cent population decline driven  rampant poaching and habitat loss.In 2010, governments of the 13 tiger range countries decided that innovative conservation efforts were needed.The most ambitious and visionary species conservation goal was set: to double the number of wild tigers  2022 – the next Chinese year of the tiger.

In the name of hosting 13th SA Games, we will have modern infrastructures which will be useful for another two-three decades,” he said.“If all the commitments are fulfilled and the stakeholders work accordingly, we can host the games in 2018,” Shrestha said.“The hosting of SA Games is not limited only to the government or NOC, it has to be a matter of pride for every Nepal people.”Niranjan Rajbanshi, Treasurer of AIPS-Asia, said the hosting of SA Games in 2018 would be a day dream if the concerned authorities keep working at snail’s pace.“Practically it is not possible to host the Games  2018 as we have not started the preparation yet,” said Rajbanshi. “A lot of things have to be done and I don’t think we will be able to complete the works in one and half years,” he added.NSJF IPP Ajay Phuyal said Nepal should utilise the 13th SA Games as an opportunity.“We have to make it a grand event and not organise for the sake of doing it,” he said. NSJF General Secretary Prakash Timalsina accused the government of not doing anything for the last six months since taking the flag from India.NSJF First Vice-president Durganath Subedi — who facilitated the programme — read out the message of AIPS President Gianni Merlo’s message, which focused on fight against corruption and doping in sports worldwide.

800,Met department to use radiosonde data to predict lightning,twitter,"The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology will soon be able to predict lightning  using radiosonde data, which is expected to improve the existing weather forecasting system.The DHM informed that three balloons carrying radiosonde will be flown every day, one each from Dharan, Kathmandu and Surkhet at 00:00 GMT (05:45 am Nepal time) to collect data on atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity. “Through the balloons, we will obtain the data required to make forecasts of lightning strikes at least 10 minutes ahead so people can go to safer places,” Risi Ram Sharma, director general at DHM, told The Himalayan Times.In the last five years, lightning strikes have killed 612 people and injured 1,266.From April 13 to June 29 this year, 109 lightning strike accidents have been recorded, with 59 people killed, 134 injured, and a loss of property worth Rs 2,435,000. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology is preparing to use radiosonde to be able to predict lightning strikes 10 minutes to a few hours ahead, giving people enough time to move to a safer place.Sharma said the DHM would start operating the balloons  next monsoon. DHM has selected three places as radiosonde stations that would receive atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity data of the Nepali sky.Each flight of balloons carrying radiosonde costs 150 to 200 USD. After regular operation the balloons, DHM will form a lightning detection network to conduct a detailed study of lightning strikes and collect data throughout the country in the next phase.Meteorologist Mani Ratna Sakya said scientists can predict thunder strikes up to one hour ahead  studying cumulonimbus clouds through use radiosonde. He said the increased incident of lightning strikes is a result of climate change.“With the help of radiosonde, predicting lightning will become easier and more effective, saving hundreds of lives,” he said, adding, “Climate change has caused land surface temperature and air moisture to increase faster, making cumulonimbus clouds hotter, which increases incidents of lightning.”Sakya suggested to the public to stay indoors during lightning strikes to stay safe. “Lightning bolts are electric currents with a temperature of more than 10,000 degrees, and can easily spread in wet and metallic objects, so people need to stay safe,” he added, “The best way to survive from thunderbolts is to put metal bars from roofs to underground in every household.”The DHM informed that it has been preparing to install weather radars in three different places throughout the country to predict precipitation from cloud, calculate its motion, and estimate its rain, snow, and hail types.Ratanagla hill of Surkhet at an altitude of 2,200 m, Ripdikot of Palpa at an altitude of 1800 m, and Nametar Chitre of Udayapur at 2400 m have been selected for installation of weather radars  the start of 2018. Each radar costs at least Rs 300,000,000.

Monetary targets
Inflation - 7.5 per cent
 
Money supply growth - 17 per cent
Growth in lending to private sector - 20 per cent
Kathmandu, July 14Depositors, who complain about losing money  parking their savings in banks because of negative real interest rate, and borrowers, who gripe about sudden hike in lending rates, may get some respite in the coming days, as Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is all set to make a strategic shift in monetary operations  introducing interest rate corridor.This is the main highlight of the Monetary Policy of Fiscal Year 2016-17 launched today  NRB, the central bank.Interest rate corridor, or IRC, is a mechanism that guides short-term market rates and helps keep all interest rates within certain band, reducing interest rate volatility. This means introduction of IRC will provide clear signals to bankers, policymakers, borrowers and depositors on how short-term interest rates will move in the market, enabling them to make decisions accordingly.This is ultimately expected to benefit end depositors and borrowers, who are tired of dealing with sudden drop or hike in interest rates.“We are introducing this mechanism in the next fiscal year as it is being used worldwide to reduce interest rate volatility. We believe this mechanism will modernise our monetary operations,” NRB Governor Chiranjibi Nepal said, launching the Monetary Policy for the next fiscal year, which is beginning on Saturday.Once IRC is introduced, NRB will shift from ‘quantity-based operating target to interest-based operating target in monetary operations’, according to Nara Bahadur Thapa, executive director at the Research Department of NRB.NRB is currently using money market instruments to mop up liquidity from and inject liquidity into the banking sector. But interest rates on these instruments, such as repo or reverse repo, outright purchase or sale auctions, and term deposit, are determined through auctions, meaning they are not fixed. As a result, rates have dropped below one per cent due to excess liquidity in the banking sector.IRC at a glance
Standing liquidity facility rate to work as ceiling rate of interest rate corridor
Two-week repo rate, or policy rate, to be fixed  adding 200 basis points, or two percentage points, to weighted average interbank rate of commercial banks of two working days ago
Two-week term deposit rate, or floor rate, to be fixed  deducting 10 basis points from weighted average interbank rate of commercial banks of two working days ago
Once the new mechanism is introduced, instruments floated  NRB to keep IRC functioning will come with fixed interest rates and will be extended to banks and financial institutions (BFIs) on proportional basis — albeit rates on other money market instruments will be fixed through auction as in the present day.To keep IRC running, NRB will basically take support of standing liquidity facility, two-week repurchase (repo) facility and two-week term deposit facility.Standing liquidity facility, under IRC, is a mechanism to provide loans to BFIs for a maximum of five days in case there is severe shortage of cash. NRB provides this credit on back of collateral, such as bonds and other securities issued  government and NRB.The annual interest on this loan is currently fixed at seven per cent. This interest rate, which can fluctuate over the time, will work as the ceiling of IRC.The floor of IRC, on the other hand, will be created using the interest rate fixed on two-week term deposit facility.The term deposit facility is an instrument that NRB uses to absorb, or borrow, money from BFIs. Under IRC, term deposit rate would be fixed  deducting 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, from weighted average interbank rate of commercial banks of two working days ago.In between the standing liquidity facility rate and two-week term deposit rate will lie two-week repo rate.This repo rate would be fixed  adding 200 basis points, or two percentage points, to weighted average interbank rate of commercial banks of two working days ago. This rate, according to NRB, will function as the policy rate, or the rate at which NRB will extend loans to BFIs for a period of up to two weeks. This credit will be extended on the back of collateral, according to NRB.It is now almost certain that there will be huge difference between three different sets of interest rates, once IRC is introduced.This is because standing liquidity facility rate, or the ceiling rate, is currently fixed at seven per cent, while term deposit rate, or the floor rate, will hover around 0.9 per cent, considering latest weighted average interbank rate of commercial banks of one per cent. If this interbank rate were to be taken into account, then the policy repo rate would stand at three per cent.Generally, the wedge between ceiling and policy rates, and policy and floor rates should not be so wide.And this is what bankers are concerned about.“We were asking NRB to introduce IRC to ensure interest rate stability and provide some respite to depositors who are getting low returns. But IRC proposed  NRB is not likely to address these issues because policy repo and term deposit rates are being fixed on the basis of weighted average interbank rate, which always remains depressed in Nepal because of shortage of high-yielding money market and debt instruments,” Sanima Bank CEO Bhuvan Kumar Dahal said. “So, we urge NRB to work towards raising term deposit (or floor) rate and ensuring the gap between floor, policy and ceiling rates is not wider than 100 basis points.”Said NRB Executive Director Thapa: “We are cautiously taking steps as we are moving into uncharted waters. But there is scope for further improvement and it will depend on how market participants will react.”Forex facilities

NRB had made an announcement to introduce this mechanism during the tenure of previous governor Yubaraj Khatiwada. But the plan was never implemented.The difference this time is that the Monetary Policy for the next fiscal year incorporates a detailed plan on how the IRC would function, which has raised hopes for its early implementation.To introduce the IRC, NRB will now direct the Open  MarketOperation Committee to draft a guideline, which will have to be endorsed  the board of NRB, before it comes into effect.“If things go according to plan, we will make all preparations to introduce IRC within a month of commencement of new fiscal year,” NRB Deputy Governor Chinta Mani Siwakoti told The Himalayan Times.",0
802,Govt exceeds expectations in awarding contracts of ADB-funded projects,Youtube,"The government has exceeded expectations in awarding contracts of the projects funded  the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the first two quarters of this year.There is not much reason to cheer though, as the government has failed to show improvement in indicators for effective and timely implementation of the ADB-funded projects. This was revealed during the tripartite portfolio review meeting of the ADB-funded projects held here with participation from representatives of ADB, Ministry of Finance and line agencies today.The project completion deadline of the major projects has been extended many times due to lack of government’s efficacy in implementing the projects.However, ADB has said that the contracts awarded in the first two quarters (January to March and April to June) is encouraging. In the six months, the government has awarded contracts of ADB-funded projects worth $157.5 million against ADB’s projection of $145.3 million. On the flip side, disbursement of the ADB-funded projects is very low. Disbursement amount stood at $73.8 million against ADB’s projection of $89 million in the review period.The Manila-based donor agency has recently pledged to raise the lending level to $500 million per annum, but the country is yet to develop the capacity to mobilise the current funding availability of $275 million per annum due to weak performance in project implementation.The cumulative ADB portfolio in Nepal at present stands at $1.72 billion, including both loans and grants, of which 57 per cent of the amount was still to be awarded contract and 74 per cent to be disbursed at the beginning of 2016, as per ADB.“We have established an annual target of $414 million contract award and $247 million disbursement for 2016 and also agreed for realistically achievable targets,” said Kenichi Yokoyama, ADB country director for Nepal.The ADB and the government review the progress of ADB-funded projects every six months to expedite the project implementation  resolving identified barriers. Today’s portfolio review meeting focused on generic issues that have been discussed regularly since a few years back.Weak project management capacity of execution agency; delays in procurement and disbursement; close monitoring and support to implementing agencies and Ministry of Finance; high risks in procurement and contract administration and weak inter-agency coordination on environment/forest clearance, and land acquisition, among others were highlighted as major obstacles for effective and timely project implementation.During the meeting, ADB country director expressed his concern over the dismal progress on some of the critical projects, namely Emergency Earthquake Assistance Project of $200 million, of which only five per cent of contract award target has been met.“School component is a major concern, and we request Department of Education to urgently deploy deputy project manager (engineer) dedicated to ADB project to central project implementation unit and expedite supervision consultant recruitment and work procurement,” Yokoyama said.Similarly, he also drew the government’s attention on Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project of $75 million, of which only two per cent of disbursement target has been met. Deadline for the project has been extended twice already to 2018, but whether the extended deadline will be met remains doubtful.

803,Snail-paced Melamchi excavation,Youtube,"The rate of tunnel excavation of the Melamchi Water Supply Project has decreased from an average of 29 metres to just one metre per day for the last three days because the excavation put stress on the soil, leading to instability. The Melamchi Water Supply Development Board said that a portion of loose soil has been appearing since July 15, making it necessary to decrease the average excavation speed  96 per cent.Excavating loose soil is risky, because it is important to keep the area stable.“We noticed the loose soil while keeping the soft rock section stable on July 15,” Executive Director at Melamchi Water Supply Development Board Ghanashyam Bhattarai told The Himalayan Times, “So we had to bring the excavation speed down considerably. Before that, our excavation speed was 29 metres per day.”Bhattarai said that it appears the problem will continue for more than one week. “It appears that the next nine metres of the tunnel will be covered with loose soil, so we can only excavate one metre daily until the portion is finished, which will take another nine days,” Bhattarai added.About 500 to 600 construction workers are currently involved in the excavation and clearance under the Italian firm CMC Cooperativa Muratori e Cementisti di Ravenna.Deputy Executive Director of the Board Jyoti Kumar Shrestha said the average excavation rate of the tunnel had decreased  25 metres daily since June because of soft rocks in the tunnel.Shrestha said despite these setbacks, the target of supplying water  September 2017 could be achieved.The project aims to excavate the tunnel at an average speed of one kilometre per month, but various hurdles have reduced the speed to around 800 metres a month.Of the planned 27.5 km long tunnel, 9.5 km remains to be excavated. The MWSP has allocated a year forcompletion of this section, which will be  July next year.The Melamchi project was envisioned in the late 1990s, but the first agreement to construct the project was only signed in 2003 with funds from various donors and developmental partners. The project took off only in 2010, seven years after the agreement was signed.Construction works were halted until the government gave the contract to CMC Cooperativa Muratori e Cementisti di Ravenna in July, 2013.The Melamchi Water Supply Development Board had awarded the contract to CMC with a target of completing the project  February 19, 2016. But last year’s earthquakes closed down construction work completely for around 10 months.The government had earlier given the contract to China Railway 15 Bureau Group, but the contract was terminated on September 2012 due to its unsatisfactory work.

804,CBS set to conduct Economic Census for first time in country,,"The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the government agency that collects, processes, analyses and disseminates statistics, will soon conduct an Economic Census to get a comprehensive view of enterprises operating in the country and understand how the economy is functioning. This is the first time Nepal is conducting an Economic Census, although many developed and developing countries carry out such studies every five to 10 years.“We have already prepared the concept of the programme. We will prepare enumeration maps this fiscal year and conduct a pilot survey to assess the effectiveness of questionnaires that we have prepared. We will then begin field work in 2018 and make the results public  mid-2019,” CBS Director General Suman Raj Aryal told The Himalayan Times.The survey will cover all micro, small, medium and large enterprises operating in formal and informal sectors, excluding those belonging to agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.“We are not including enterprises related to agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the study, because we have already started conducting Agriculture Census every 10 years,” said Aryal, adding, “The survey will also exclude public administration and extra-territorial organisations and bodies, such as embassies.”Once the census is complete, the country will have a depository of information on enterprises engaged in retail and wholesale trade, construction, real estate, finance, communications, transportation, information technology, hospitality, utilities, health, education and other manufacturing and services sectors.The survey will also shed light on technologies these enterprises have adopted, number of jobs they have created, products they are churning out and revenue they are generating.“In short, the study will explain how industrialisation process is moving forward and the level of modernisation of this process,” said Aryal.The information generated through the census can be used  the government to assess the effectiveness of various policies it has introduced and frame new policies to facilitate growth of various industries or attract foreign investment. Also, the census results can be used  businesses to compare where they stand in terms of industry average, find out where there is huge concentration of enterprises and locate potential areas where businesses can be expanded.“So, statistics collected through the census would help both government and businesses to make decisions and frame strategic plans,” said Aryal.To gather this information, the CBS will make use of questionnaires.“The questionnaires will be uploaded on our website. But we know many entrepreneurs or traders are not IT literate. So, we will be conducting computer-assisted personal interviews, under which tablets and laptops will be used to make entry of responses made  interviewees. Also, paper-based questionnaires will also be distributed,” said Aryal.

805,KP Sharma Oli wrongly refers to little people of Africa as ‘Lilliput’,online khabar,"CPN-UML chairman and former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, speaking at a function organised by the party’s youth wing National Youth Federation in the capital on September 6, criticised his former party colleagues and the current government. In his almost hour-long speech, Oli attacked the parties in the ruling alliance, particularly the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led splinter group and the Maoists.Oli said, “There’s a tribe in Africa called Lilliput. They are small people. They begin reproduction when they are seven or eight years old. By the age of 15, they become old and stop reproduction.  Most die at the age of 20, and if someone reaches 25, they would be happy just like when we turn 100 years old. [In Africa], there’s a small tribe, which is unique and is called Lilliput.”South Asia Check examined the claim.Oli claimed that there are little people called Lilliput in Africa. But, there is no such tribe called Lilliput.Lilliput in fact is the fictional island nation in Jonathan Swift’s famous novel Gulliver’s Travels, published in 1726. In the novel, Lilliput is home to tiny people called Lilliputians, who are just six inches tall. In Lilliput, it is not only people who are short but the whole environment and infrastructures are tiny, too. In the novel, which the British newspaper The Guardian ranked one of 100 best novels in 2013, Swift, an Irish satirist, chronicles the journey of Lemuel Gulliver, the book’s protagonist. The book does not mention the Lilliputians’ biological characteristics but describes them as smart, selfish and violent people. The novel also features Blefuscudians, inhabitants of another tiny island called Blefuscu. Blefuscudians are the enemies of Lilliputians.Our research found that Oli’s description of the people somewhat matched the Pygmy tribes who live in Africa and Asia. Pygmies are hunter-gatherers and are around five feet tall. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the most known pygmies live in tropical Africa. They live in the jungles of central and west Africa in countries such as Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. Their population is estimated at 120,000.The life expectancy of these people is between 16 and 24 years. As they have short lifespans, their puberty starts early. The pygmies in Asia are commonly known as Negritos. Although he called the small people from Africa ‘Lilliput’, which is a fictitious place, from his description it seems Oli was referring to the Pygmies, who reach reproductive maturity early and have short lifespans.",1
806,Ram Kumari Jhakri’s claim that Oli didn’t bring any Covid-19 vaccine was false,Injina Panthi,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Socialist, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, speaking on the Yoho Bahas programme aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. During the interview, she said Prime Minister Oli issued a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal and hastily inaugurated the Dharahara in an attempt to project himself as a nationalist and development-oriented leader. She also claimed that there was no development project that was started and completed during his tenure.She said in the interview, “Show me just one development project that was started and completed during his tenure. Not even the vaccine came. Not even the vaccine, you know….His advisors were tweeting that the 7 million vaccine doses donated by the US to Asia were for Nepal. He would mislead people with such claims and is still trying to do so.”The claim by Jhakri, who is also a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, that no vaccine came during Oli’s tenure is false.Let’s look at the facts.Sher Bahadur Deuba was appointed prime minister on July 13, 2021. On the same day, the Health Ministry issued a report that said altogether 1,828,484 people had received their first dose of the Covishield vaccine and 460,743 people had received the second dose of the vaccine. Likewise, 783,323 people had received their first dose of the Chinese Vero Cell vaccine and 642,396 people had received the second dose of the vaccine, according to the report.The Oli government rolled out a vaccination campaign seven months ago. The campaign kicked off after Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, the then director of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, received the first jab of Covishield on January 27.According to the Health Ministry, on January 21, 2021, India donated 1 million doses of the Covishield vaccine to the Nepal government and 100,000 doses of the vaccine to the Nepal Army.In early 2021, Nepal struck a deal with India’s Serum Institute to procure 2 million doses of Covishield. Though 1 million doses arrived on February 21, 2021, the Indian company failed to send the remaining shipment, dealing a blow to the country’s vaccination drive.As Nepal scrambled for vaccines, China stepped in providing 1.8 million doses of the Vero Cell vaccine produced by Chinese company Sinopharm. In late March, Nepal received 800,000 doses of Vero Cell.In early June, the Chinese government sent an additional 1 million doses of the Vero Cell vaccine. Similarly, under the Covax program, a UN-backed scheme to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, Nepal received 304,800 doses of the Covishield vaccine. The US government also donated over 1.5 million doses of the single-dose Janssen vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson.In June, the Nepal government struck a deal to buy 4 million doses of Vero Cell with Sinopharm, with the first consignment arriving on July 21, 2021. The deal was struck by the Oli government.Although the Astrazeneca vaccine Japan donated to Nepal arrived on August 7, after Deuba was appointed the prime minister, the country had announced the delivery a month earlier. The Japanese-donated jabs were administered to the elderly who had not received the second dose after the Indian company failed to deliver Covishield vaccines to Nepal.Therefore, Jhakri’s claim that Nepal did not receive Covid-19 vaccines during former Prime Minister Oli’s tenure is false.

807,Commentator Saurabh falsely claims a 1958 postage stamp had a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal,South Asia Check,"Writer and political commentator Saurabh speaking on the Tamasoma Jyotirgamaya programme aired on AP1 television on July 19 claimed that a postage stamp issued by the Nepal government in 1958 features a Nepal map with a pointed spur on the northwestern corner.He made the claim in the context of the immediate past government issuing a new map of Nepal last year by including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas within the Nepali territory. The inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed by India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill by parliament.“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But, the Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years’ term of the immediate past government led by KP Sharma Oli.South Asia Check examined the claim.Likewise, a ticket issued in February 1959 to mark the first general elections has the national flag and Nepal map, but the map does not have the pointed spur. Other postage stamps issued in the same year do not have the Nepal map.In 1954, a map series of postage stamps was issued featuring the map of Nepal, but none contains the pointed spur.This information is from the publication titled “Nepal Postage Stamp Catalogue 1881-2015.” We also spoke to the president of Nepal Philatelic Society, Shankar Shrestha, who corroborated the aforementioned information. Therefore, writer Saurabh’s claim that the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS featured a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal is false.",1
808,"Some Nepali social media users shared 5G increases Covid-19 cases. But, it’s baseless"," Deepak Adhikari
","A false claim about 5G, which is the fifth generation of wireless telephony, is circulating among social media users in Nepal. The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched.

A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared by more than 4,500 people.

The post reads as follows:

“Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused by the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in the surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”The same content has been shared on Facebook here, here and here. The claim includes photographs of the anti-5G protests in London of the UK and in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.Last year, similar claims had gone viral in various European countries including the United Kingdom. India’s Alt News and Factly have also fact-checked such claims.Now, South Asia Check has investigated the false claim, which is currently circulating among Nepalis.5G is the most advanced technology for mobile phones. The fifth-generation technology will radically change the way people use the internet in their life. Madhu Sudan Dahal, a senior telecommunications engineer at Nepal Telecom, tells South Asia Check that 4G service is currently available in Nepal and 5G is only being tested. 5G is a more advanced technology than 4G, Dahal says. In order to operate 5G, telecom companies need to update and upgrade hardware (such as antennas) and software, according to him.While it is true that mobile phones spread electromagnetic waves, various studies have shown them to be harmless, the telecom engineer says. “People may have been misled by the fact that both the electromagnetic waves the mobile phone generates and the coronavirus are invisible,” he says. “The electromagnetic waves cause no harm.”Here is how the frequency of mobile telephony works, according to him: “When we speak over a mobile phone, our voice is picked up by the nearest tower via waves. It then reaches the server of the telecommunications service provider, which in turn sends it to the nearest tower to the person we are calling. The tower that gives the best signal transmits my voice.”In order to provide high-speed internet via 5G, telecom service providers install many small cell sites to poles, walls or towers (unlike previous networks, which used huge towers), according to experts In India, telecom companies including Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have tested the 5G technology in various cities, but they are yet to roll out the service for consumers. While it is true that the Indian states mentioned in the Facebook post had seen a surge in Covid-19 cases in India, the claim that the 5G technology is being tested in those states is wrong.In its fact sheet published last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the coronavirus does not spread through 5G mobile networks. “Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks,” the WHO said.Before the launch of 5G in the UK last year, the Chinese mobile company Huawei, which is involved in building the 5G infrastructure, faced rumours that it would spy on the mobile users, so this time some people might have used the coronavirus to spread misinformation about the 5G technology, according to Dahal, the telecom engineer. “People suspected that the government could use the technology for the surveillance of its citizens,” he says.

809,"Viral on Nepal social media, ‘home remedy’ for boosting blood oxygen levels is unfounded"," Deepak Adhikari
","As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages in Nepal, people have been sharing various kinds of information related to the disease including some supposed home remedies on social media platforms. One such social media post accompanied by a picture suggesting a traditional remedy for low blood oxygen levels has been widely shared on Twitter andFacebook.The post reads as follows: “Take three-four cubes of camphor, three-four cloves, a teaspoon of carom seeds and two-three drops of eucalyptus oil, wrap up the mixture in a piece of soft cotton cloth and sniff it from time to time. [Every time] after sniffing, put the pouch back into a Ziploc bag. If Eucalyptus oil is not available, you can do without it.”On April 26, Rama Singh, a former news anchor of the state-run Nepal Television, shared a picture along with the message on her Facebook page. Facebook users have thanked Singh for the information. One user also shared a Hindi-language video clip with instructions for preparing and using the remedy. Singh’s post has received 30 responses and more than 4,000 shares on Facebook. The post along the picture has been shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook. The post had gone viral in India. In Nepal, it appears that many social media users have shared Singh’s post.South Asia Check found the supposed remedy is misleading and baseless.According to Prakash Gyawali, a doctor of traditional Ayurveda medicine, although camphor, cloves and carom seeds are natural ingredients used in traditional remedies, the claim that their use boosts blood oxygen levels in humans is unfounded. “The Ayurveda hasn’t described these items as medicines. In order for something to be an Ayurvedic medicine, it has to be mentioned in the related literature,” Gyawali tells South Asia Check.Camphor helps open the nose in case of cold while cloves dry the phlegm, Gyawali says. “Carom seed is also mixed in various medicines. If you have chest problems, it is used because of its expectorant or drying properties,” he says.A mix of eucalyptus oil and herbs can be used to relieve cough symptoms, according to him. “It can be used as a nasal decongestant. It makes it easier to breathe, but there is no evidence that it raises oxygen levels,” he says.Dr Pushpa Mani Kharal, the medical superintendent at Mulpani Municipal Hospital in Kathmandu, says there is no evidence that using the herbs would increase the blood oxygen level. “To increase the oxygen level, your lungs have to be healthy. Or oxygen should be given artificially,” Kharal tells South Asia Check.“There are other ways such as lying in a prone position (sleeping on your knees and belly), deep breathing, etc. These exercises can make breathing easier,” he says.Also, we did an extensive search on Google, but could not find any reliable information to support the claim that the aforementioned mixture boosts blood oxygen levels. You can read about the benefits of camphor and clove on WebMD, a US-based publisher of health-related information.Based on the statements of the two doctors and other references, the widely shared claim that the use of a mix of camphor, clove, carom seeds and eucalyptus oil increases the oxygen level is misleading and baseless.

810,"Defying court order, Kathmandu police arrest 2 journalists for publishing fake news",online khabar,"A team deployed from the Metropolitan Police Range in Kathmandu has arrested two journalists on the charge of publishing a fake news item.Nepal’s press freedom law does not allow the police to arrest a journalist in relation to their journalistic works. Rather, the offences should be dealt with by Press Council Nepal.Owing to the same, the Patan High Court last week ordered the police not to arrest any journalist in connection with any news item they produce.However, the law enforcers went to the office of Ujyaalo Network and arrested its executive editor Anish Tamang and general manager DL Tamang (Prabhat) on Sunday afternoon.SSP Ashok Singh, the chief of the range, says they would be accused of cybercrime, forgery and crime against the state for further investigation.Some days ago, the website had published a news report claiming Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had signed an agreement with Samanta Kumar Goel, who had visited him in October 2020. Later, the report was proved to be false, and the publisher had apologised.

811,Old photos of foreign fires being circulated as Nepal wildfire photos,Sanjog Shiwakoti,"Nepal’s major cities including Kathmandu and Pokhara are blanketed by the smoke from the raging wildfires across the country over the last few days. In the absence of strong winds, the smog remains suspended over the Nepali sky. On March 26, Kathmandu was ranked the world’s most polluted city, by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company. The severe air pollution has forced the government to close schools in many districts including the capital, Kathmandu, for four days. Flights to and from Kathmandu and other airports have been suspended or diverted due to poor visibility.Social media users have taken to Twitter and Facebook to draw the world’s attention to the disaster. On March 31, the #PrayforNepal hashtag trended on Twitter. Social media users have shared various pictures of the wildfires. The photos have been shared here, here on Twitter and here, here on Facebook. But we found that some of these photos are misleading.

Among the photos, one photo went viral. The photo shows an Indian flag among the NCP party flags held by demonstrators. Some online news outlets also published reports claiming that the Indian flag was also used in the demonstration.South Asia Check examined the photo and the claim.Janata Times Online published a news report headlined ‘Indian flag in demonstration led by Prachanda-Madhav, anti-Nepal scheme exposed’. But the outlet later corrected the news and changed its headline as “Indian flag in demonstration led by Prachanda-Madhav!”.The outlet apologised saying it got misled and also published the original photo, which does not contain the Indian flag.Similarly, Chakrapath Online published a report with the photo under the headline: ‘Indian flag used in demonstration organised by Prachanda-Madhav!’A Twitter handle called @iambishalbhatta tweeted the photo along with this text: “In the demonstration organized by the Prachanda-Madhav faction in Kathmandu, someone was found waving Indian flag and chanting slogans against Prime Minister KP Oli.”The photo has been retweeted 61 times.  Similarly, the photo with the same text shared by Bishal Bhatta on Facebook has been shared 161 times.The photo shared by Twitter handle @khadga_acharya has been retweeted 13 times.Similarly, Ganesh Basnet shared a  link of Janata Times news on Facebook. His post has been shared 652 times. Many users have also shared the photo on a public Facebook group called Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Fact check: South Asia Check ran a ‘reverse image search’ of the photo and found that the original photo was published almost a month and a half ago by the Nepali-language daily Annapurna Post on its website along with a report of the December 29, 2020 protest rally organized by the Dahal-Nepal faction of the Nepal Communist Party.The photo does not contain the Indian flag. It was published under the headline ‘NCP’s protest against the dissolution of parliament (photo feature)’.The photos are credited to Uma Bista and Sunita Dangol. So we have concluded that the photo shared February 10 was photoshopped to mislead viewers.

813,‘Red mercury’ claims on social media just a hoax,online khabar,"Over the past few days, social media users in Nepal have posted photos and statuses along with claims that old TV and radio sets that purportedly contain a substance called “re d mercury” would fetch fortunes.“Old TV and radio sets contain red mercury, which costs tens of millions of rupees a gram. Check it out on YouTube,” read Facebook user Mayur Shrestha’s post.Commenting on a Twitter thread, Sadiksha Karki wrote, “Philips (a Dutch multinational company) is itself looking for the substance. Because the substance used in the radio is rare, a team from Germany is visiting Nepal and India (in search of it).”On Facebook posts, most users have responded to the offer claiming they have it. While some users have asked those claiming to possess the substance to inbox [send private messages on social media] their contact details.What is “red mercury”?Contrary to what is being portrayed on social media platforms, red mercury is not a hidden treasure but a source of countless rumours and myths that have persisted for decades. Though it is shrouded in mystery, with its existence unproven yet, the myths around it have thrived since the Cold War. In a 2019 article, the BBC said adverts and video offering “red mercury” for sale were found online. In 2015, The New York Times Magazine published a long-form report by war correspondent CJ Chivers with the headline: The Doomsday Scam. The New York Times’ story details how the ISIS fighters embarked on the quest to find red mercury.What can be deduced from these articles is that con artists in several countries have used this dubious substance to swindle the unsuspecting public. In 2007, scientific journal Science Direct published a research paper titled ‘Analysis of an Object Assumed to Contain Red Mercury’. The study also found no red mercury in the samples the researchers had collected.According to the UK-based risk assessment and intelligence firm S-RM, red mercury is not thought to exist outside of conspiracy theories, though US physicist Samuel Cohen had claimed it existed. Mercury is a substance used to make nuclear weapons. This substance, like lead, can hold a large amount of heat. It is also used for medicinal purposes.In India since September, rumours about red mercury have been spreading through social media platforms and YouTube channels. Claims that it was worth tens of thousands of rupees went viral on Hindi-language websites and digital platforms. India’s fact-checking website Factly has debunked the rumour.In Nepal, people have shared photos and text about red mercury on a Facebook group called ‘Nepali Purano Paisa’ which has more than 57,000 users. The Facebook group shares posts about old coins and banknotes. Users have posted photos of a small bottle with red liquid. Various users have said that they have it or are willing to buy it.We spoke to Basant Giri, a scientist at Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences about this. “It looks like a hoax circulating around for decades across the globe,” he told South Asia Check. “There’s no such chemical or material called red mercury.” He said the red-coloured liquid may just be “red dye” or some mercury compound which does not have a “special” price as such. “Rather, most of the mercury compounds are toxic,” he said. “The old electronic devices contain some heavy metals such as lead and others. The heavy metals, which are toxic, can be recycled, but are not precious,” he said.

814,"When there are many ‘experts’ spreading unverified information, everyone has to protect themselves from infodemic",online khabar,"On September 7, Kathmandu police arrested Subas Subba Limbu on the charge of accusing doctors involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients of removing organs of Covid-19 victims. He was one among several self-claimed ‘experts’ who were busy giving interviews to YouTube channels about the coronavirus and Covid-19.The presence of such experts on YouTube and other social media platforms have turned this pandemic into an infodemic. There are many people around you who are claiming that Covid-19 is not a pandemic at all, this is just a scam run by the medical corporate mafia including the WHO. There are many conspiracy theories alike such as the one claimed by Limbu.As per the Nepal Twitter Users Survey conducted by the Centre for Media Research-Nepal in November last year, 95% of Nepali internet users are exposed to disinformation. Apparently, the flow of such unverified information and false information has increased amidst the pandemic.However, controlling this flow is next to impossible. There come questions of freedom of expression and speech. In today’s world, no one can stop anyone from expressing their opinions as at the heart of democracy lies the freedom of speech. Neither can police or concerned authorities arrest or take legal actions on hundreds of them.So, how can the confused mass look at the issue? Experts of different fields suggest the public, the media, and the government have their own shares of responsibilities.Kundan Aryal, a media educator at Central Department of Journalism and Mass Communication in Tribhuvan University, thinks the government cannot control such activities, but the mainstream media have to be responsible to ensure the free flow of right information.“From the lens of freedom of speech, we do not look too much into the role of the government. rather we look for the role of the media. It is their responsibility to not confuse the public or mislead them.”For Aryal, this problem is also related to the idea of media literacy. In many countries where the rate of media literacy is high, audience members themselves critically judge what and how much to believe and what and how much not, and filter the contents of the media. However, this is not the case here.Aryal believes that each individual has their own filter by which they verify or evaluate the media contents by using their knowledge, wisdom, and experience. The major basis for their verification can be by questioning the credibility of the media via which such contents are coming.Likewise, journalist Shree Ram Paudel, also another faculty member of the department, shares, “While consuming any type of media content, the audience needs to be aware and have the capacity to filter them. Media literacy plays a great part here.”Further, he explains, “If we see this from a practical approach, there are two types of news, one that should be given to the public by finding them, and the other type of information is generally searched by the public themselves. During the period of the pandemic, both types should be considered. And, For those who cannot critically filter or are not media literate, the government should be responsible to provide the truthful information.”But, before the government, it is the ‘mainstream’ media’s responsibility to provide truthful information to the people as the rate of media literacy is very low in Nepal, Aryal suggests.
To be precise, what mainstream media can do in this case is that they need to inform the people that some misleading contents are also being circulated around them and making them aware of why it is misleading. The media should help their audiences judge the media contents, according to him.Aryal says the mainstream media should come forward to include controversial issues to clear doubts among the public. Noting that there are many issues that the mainstream media do not talk about, but social media users including YouTube channels are exaggerating, he says the mainstream media also need to conduct “full-fledged discussions” on such conflicting and confusing issues and make people aware.Likewise, Paudel says the communicators, who create contents, should also be responsible, “You yourself should be responsible while using your right to freedom of expression. Everyone as a citizen has the right to speak in the matter of public concern. However, if the matter is technical, it is always better that technicians or experts in that sector speak, but the experts should update their knowledge regularly.”Paudel advises further, “They need to present their ideas with sufficient reasoning and facts. Experts should put forward their views, being truthful and with a lot of reasoning. They also need to consider the seriousness of the situation, for example during this pandemic.”Regarding the role of mainstream media, Aryal and Paudel have slightly different views. Aryal thinks the mainstream media have an opportunity to prove why there still exists the significance of a media organisation in our society even when there are social media and other forms of new media. But, Paudel also thinks the pandemic might have crippled the efficiency of the “mainstream” media also.“It is no secret that there has been a huge economic impact on the media industry due to this pandemic that has forced them to limit the human resources and the area of the reporting.”But, Aryal believes when and where responsible and authentic media outlets come forward actively, there will be no place for false, confusing and misleading contents.Aryal predicts that there could emerge chaos if there comes a situation in which people start believing each and every content given to them by any media.Corroborating with Aryal, retired Nepal Police DIG Hemanta Malla Thakuri also thinks the dominance of misinformation could also be a security threat in the future.“The concept of security threat is way beyond what we generally understand. Generally, we take protests, robberies, fights, and these things as a security threat. There exists many security threats such as medical or health security threats, environmental security threats, and many more.”As a possible solution to this issue, Thakuri suggests that the government should take the lead and give easy and truthful information to the public, repeatedly on a daily basis so that the general public has a clear view of this.Paudel also shares a similar opinion regarding the role of government in this issue, also criticising the government for failing to play this role. He puts forward, “Rather than giving priority to the pandemic, the engagement of the government is mostly seen within the ruling party’s internal conflicts. The density of the flow of information by the government (as it just gives an update every 24 hours) is not enough to actually clear all the doubts and confusions.”Additionally, he recommends, “In this situation where the public is so confused, concerned authorities that include the Ministry of the Health and Population and other mechanisms under this ministry, should come to the frontline and clarify repeatedly on a regular basis.”Why keeping people safe from false information and rumours is importantIn the world of social media where a way to control the flow of information is rare, except self-censorship, the flooding of multiple views on one particular issue is not strange.According to psychologist Basu Acharya, the flooding of misinformation or disinformation is bound to arouse irritation and anger among the confused public. This may also induce a serious mental problem called acute stress disorder, leading to trauma.Acharya asks those who are speaking or making claims on such sensitive matters without even calculating the impacts of their views on the general public to be mindful of what they are sharing. But, he implies, it is the public’s, the consumers’ responsibility, to protect themselves from any disaster.

815,‘Naturopath’ who accused docs of removing organs from Covid-19 victims arrested,online khabar,"Police in Kathmandu have arrested a man on the charge of accusing doctors involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients of removing organs of Covid-19 victims.The arrestee has been identified as Subas Subba Limbu, who claimed himself to be a naturopath and gave interviews to various YouTube channels.A team deployed from the Metropolitan Crime Division arrested Limbu on the charge of spreading false information on Monday morning. The division’s chief SSP Deepak Kumar Thapa says he was arrested at an Ayurved clinic located at Dholahity of Lalitpur.A team deployed from the Metropolitan Police Circle, Satdobato, had also arrested him a few days ago.In various YouTube interviews, Subba had claimed bodies of the patients dying of  Covid-19 are not given to the families, neither are sent for an autopsy because the doctors remove various organs from them. The police say publishing this claim amounts to a crime because the claim has not been proven by any evidence.

However, they say four of the news channels will still remain blocked until the next decision.A meeting of the operators held on Sunday decided to continue blocking Zee News, Aaj Tak, India TV, and ABP News only, according to Dish Home Managing Director Supeep Acharya.Owing to the channels’ baseless reporting of Nepal’s decision to issue the country’s new political map and Chinese Ambassador’s engagements  with political leaders here, the cable operators had decided to block their broadcasting owing to the public pressure.The government did not take any decision about blocking the channels but thanked the cable operators for their decision.

817,‘TU psychologist’ makes several false claims in popular YouTube interview,online khabar,"The YouTube channel of Himal Online TV on April 14, 2020, uploaded an interview with Nabin Joshi, referred to as a psychologist in a video entitled “Pahilo Patak Bistrit Khulasa, Jannuhos Adrisya Khel, K Ho Bastabikta?” [Detailed revelation for the first time, know about the hidden game and the reality]. The video is trending in Nepal and is currently trending as number 11 on Youtube. It has already been viewed more than 180,600 times until Tuesday afternoon.In the interview, Nabin Joshi speaks in length about COVID-19 and makes several claims. The interviewer hasn’t provided information about Joshi other than that he is a psychologist. According to Joshi’s Facebook page, he has a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Tribhuvan University (TU). Many people have also reacted to the video that Joshi shared on Facebook.South Asia Check has examined eight of his claims.First claim:“About 25,000 to 56,000 people die each year from influenza-like illness. These deaths occur due to season change.”A report published by the World Health Organization (WHO), on December 14, 2017, states: “Up to 650,000 deaths annually are associated with respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza, according to new estimates by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization and global health partners.”Similarly, a report last reviewed on January 8, 2020, by the CDC has estimated that 34,200 people died during the 2018-2019 influenza season.On the basis of these facts, Joshi’s claim is false.Second claim:“According to an Italian government website, among the people whose deaths were associated with the coronavirus, 48.5% died from other three illnesses. 25.6% died from two other illnesses, and 25.1% of people died from 1 other illness. These other illnesses included heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and pneumonia. Among the dead, some people already had two illnesses, some already had three or more and some had only one. This report says when their swabs were tested using real-time PCR test kits that showed false positive for coronavirus. However, it says the cause of the deaths were other illnesses. It says 0.8 percent of the dead had no other illnesses and this means influenza or seasonal flu was responsible for 0.8% deaths.”The graph Joshi showed was taken from Bloomberg News and Bloomberg had analyzed the graphs prepared from Italy National Health Institute’s report. The analysis presented by Joshi in the video contradicts the analysis prepared by Bloomberg just below the graph. The Bloomberg analysis states, “The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.

More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”

The analysis does not state that the deaths occurred due to hypertension, diabetes or heart disease. Neither does it mention that the deaths occurred due to other illnesses. The report only analysed 18% of Italian COVID-19 deaths and whether the victims had pre-existing illnesses.

Joshi has given misleading information by misinterpreting the facts in the Bloomberg report.

Third claim:

“Its [PCR test kit’s] inventor was Kary B Mullis. He received the Nobel Prize for inventing this test kit 27 years ago. Since that time, WHO hasn’t recognized this kit for diagnostic purposes. Nobody used the kit for the past 27 years but it is being used now.”The first part of his claim is true. American biochemist Kary B Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993 for inventing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.But the second part of his claim is false. A report published by WHO on April 29, 2003 states, “WHO encourages each country to designate a reference laboratory for investigation and/ or referral of specimens from possible SARS patients. Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict criteria.”Similarly, WHO established a WHO working group on PCR protocols for detecting subtype influenza A viruses in 2007 to serve as an expert technical group to provide guidance to WHO on the use of PCR in the context of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).As the PCR method is used for many other purposes Joshi’s claim is inaccurate.Fourth claim:“When reports of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan came on December 31, the WHO said there was no reason to panic. But after 6-7 days, on January 8, the WHO held a meeting and said the virus is very aggressive and it’s a pandemic.”A disease outbreak news update published by the WHO on January 12, 2020, stated that the coronavirus was only seen in Wuhan and detailed investigations were ongoing.On January 13, 2020, officials confirmed a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.It is only on March 11, 2020, that the WHO declared COVID-19 as the pandemic.Based on the facts above, Joshi’s claim is false.Fifth claim:“Nine years ago today, in 2011, the European Union declared that the WHO was a robber organization.”South Asia Check could not find any such report on the internet. The media would have reported if such a serious accusation had been made by the European Union.But there are other reports and news items that provide the basis for dismissing Joshi’s claim.In 2011, the WHO, the EU, and other European countries had jointly published a report entitled “Migration and Health in the European Union” and the report has no mention of such an accusation.Similarly, in the report titled “Everything you always wanted to know about the European Union health policies but were afraid to ask” published in 2014, we found no mention of such an accusation.In addition, in September 2012, the “Health 2020: the European policy for health and well-being” framework signed by the European Union’s 53 member states also has no mention of such an accusation.In The New York Times and Science Magazine, some committees and experts have published critical views of the WHO’s response to the swine flu pandemic but these also do not contain the accusation claimed by Joshi.So, this claim is also false.Sixth claim:“It is meaningless to say that wearing a mask protects you. Mask does not protect people.”These figures also confirm that Joshi’s claim is false.

818,Fake news during Covid-19 crisis may lead kids to trauma. Here’s what psychologists have to say,online khabar,"Shivam Raj Bhandari, eight, is constantly exposed to social media mainly Facebook and YouTube. Recently, he came across one of the viral posts on Facebook that suggested that the novel coronavirus would not affect Nepalis as their immunity power was believed to be the strongest. The post influenced him and he became careless about following the preventive measures against the infection.Fortunately, he has a habit of discussing whatever he sees on social media and he asked his mother, “Is this true, mummy? As we are Nepalis, will we really not get infected by the virus? Can I go out and play with my friends now?  Will it be fine if I don’t frequently wash my hands or sanitise them?”Listening to all these, his mother clarified, “That is not true, my son. We have to follow all the preventive measures like staying at home, not touching our faces, frequently sanitising our hands and washing them with soaps to avoid contracting the Covid-19.” As an obedient son, he listened, understood and has been following this accordingly.Psychologists working with the children’s issue observe that there are many cases like Bhandari’s. However, all the children will not have ‘clarifying’ moms like him. Hence, with easy access to the information spread all over the internet, the children, not matured enough to judge what is right and wrong, are more vulnerable to physical and psychological issues during such trying times, they claim, adding the children need proper care during such period.What are the probable problems?Psychologist Basu Acharya fears that many children in Nepal are likely to experience the same kind of trauma now as they did after the 2015 earthquake.Children can be traumatised with misinformation circulating in and around the virtual as well as the real world, he explains, adding because the information may arouse them the fear of death, of themselves, their parents or the loved ones. It may haunt their psyche completely and give birth to psychological problems like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and other phobias.In this case, imagines Acharya, children may develop separation anxiety disorder—the fear of separation from home and/or from people whom they are strongly emotionally attached with (parents, caregiver, siblings or other significant people), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic attacks and disorder, addiction of mobile phone leading to adjustment disorder, as well as mood swings.As of now, Acharya says, however, he has not encountered such cases in children due to the havoc created by Covid-19 pandemic and its (mis)information flow.Corroborating Acharya, Sajeena Dhungana, who also works with children as a psychotherapist and counselor, asserts that the current situation, in particular the prevalence of misinformation about the infection and its impact, may lead the children to anxiety, panic attacks, and depressive symptoms. “They may express it through their restlessness, tantrums, nagging, fighting, shouting back and also crying. They may not let anyone go out of the home or make a huge fuss about it.”“They might isolate themselves unnecessarily and also do a lot of hand washing. They might wear masks and use sanitisers even when it is not necessary. Some children ask their parents for updates every time. They will show different behaviours according to their age and their understanding of the news.”Also, she clarifies that it takes a lot of time to become a mental problem, but parents or guardians have to be careful about such behaviours of their children.Who can solve them?Both Acharya and Dhungana believe that mainly parents, guardians, elder siblings, primary caregivers, grandparents, and other family members can be members of the children’s first and foremost support system in preventing them from being traumatised and fearful from the misinformation catered about this new disease.Acharya also states that the role of experts, media and government is also equally essential for making children aware of this pandemic with the right information and effective policies. One of the preventive steps Dhungana suggests is to keep the children away from the constant news updates to lessen the effect.Her next recommendation is to utilise the time at hand and engage them in age-appropriate activities and teach them some necessary household chores like cleaning, cooking, and working around the house. At the same time, she suggests, parents can teach children some life skills like creative and critical thinking, as well as arts and crafts. There are lots of do-it-yourself tools that can be experimented with. Books, painting, and drawings are helpful.Dhungana points out, “It is very crucial for the parents to check their mental well-being. If the parents consume with so many news and updates, it will directly affect the children. But saying, ‘I can beat coronavirus and it’s not going to touch us’ is stupid. The parents should focus on informing and involving children in precautionary measures without overwhelming them.”“Instead of pressurising or threatening them to follow preventive measures, the parents should come up with creative strategies, in which children willingly and happily engage and adopt the preventive measures,” Acharya recommends.To prevent their addiction to mobile phones during lockdown and self-isolation, they recommend that the parents should design and involve children in mindful and alternative entertaining indoor games, focusing more on flourishing their hobbies and talents.What are the remedies?Acharya suggests that trusting credible news media and filtering news for truthful information about the disease and avoiding unnecessary discussions, especially misinformation or false claims or myths about the Covid-19, can be very beneficial.Similarly, Dhungana advises that talking about the virus with the right information could be one thing and also asking what they know about the virus and what preventive measures are could be another. “It’s necessary to supervise them while they are watching TV, reading newspapers and scrolling other social media platforms as they might be absorbing the hyped and fake news. So, the family first needs to follow the right media to get the information and impart their knowledge to their kids.Simultaneously, they add, it is very important to use age-appropriate language while giving them honest and detailed answers about their queries about this viral disease. It will be more effective if these answers are coming either from experts or someone in the family whom a child trusts the most.Dhungana proposes, “If the child is found exposed to the misleading information about coronavirus, it is very essential to find out the sources of the message, and correct the information in front of them. Unnecessary exposure to news and media has to be stopped immediately not only for children but for everyone.”During other vacations, children enjoy going to the zoo, fun parks, swimming, cinema halls, and other entertainment spots. But as of now, everything has been shut down. How can children accommodate these circumstances? How can parents make appropriate use of this time especially when both parents and children are locked within their house?In response, Dhungana believes that this is the time when parents really need to be both parents and teachers. She asserts, “Talking and explaining what is social distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine should be the most important thing they should do in a way that they would not feel pressured. Also, this decreases their demand to have their dream vacation or a day-out.”Both of them suggest that parents should be creative and provide healthy, creative, engaging indoor games for children instead of TV and YouTube all the time. There are a lot of audio and visual learning materials online that are easily accessible; that can help.Even then doing all the things might not be enough for some. In that case, they need to find a professional who would guide them to help them in settling the children. Sometimes it’s difficult for the parents to talk about death and loss, at that time, reaching out to a professional is necessary.

819,COVID-19: What’s circulating on social media and what are the facts,online khabar,"Nepal government has introduced emergency measures such as closures of schools and colleges, imposed a ban on a gathering of over 25 people and arrival restrictions for passengers from Europe, the Middle East, Gulf countries, Malaysia, Turkey, South Korea, and Japan to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Misinformation and false claims about the pandemic, however, continue to spread especially through social media. We have examined several such claims being circulated among the users of social media in Nepal.Does gargling with warm water with salt or vinegar cure COVID-19?A meme circulating on Facebook and other social media platforms claim that gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar can eliminate COVID-19. It claims that after the virus reaches the throat, it remains there for four days and causes coughing and throat pain.While Nepalis have traditionally used the solution as a domestic remedy for throat pain and coughing, there’s no evidence that it cures coronavirus. According to the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gargling with warmed water mixed with salt/vinegar helps soothe a sore throat, but there’s no proof that it eliminates coronavirus.Does rinsing your nose with saline water help prevent COVID-19?It’s a misleading claim. It’s true that it can help people recover from the common cold, but it’s not a cure for the coronavirus. Debunking the myth, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said: “There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.”Can COVID-19 coronavirus survive on the surface of iron for 12 hours? A YouTube channel called Official Khabar posted a video claiming that coronavirus can survive for 12 hours on the surface of the iron. Though other tips the video has offered appeared to be accurate, this one is misleading.According to a research paper authored by scientists from the National Institute of Health and published in New England Journal of Medicine, the virus could be detected in aerosols and on surfaces ranging from a few hours to several days.  “We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel,” the report said.Will warm temperature help reduce the spread of the coronavirus?With the end of winter, the temperature is rising across Nepal. Claims that the rise of temperature above 30 degrees Celsius would help reduce the virus are being circulated on social media.But this claim is unsubstantiated. “Because the impact of influenza reduces with the onset of summer, many people seem to believe that it will help reduce the novel coronavirus from spreading during summer. As its name suggests, this is a new virus and we don’t have any evidence to support such a conclusion,” Pushpa Mani Khanal, a medical doctor, told South Asia Check.What latest researches say about COVID-19?The latest scientific researches on coronavirus have pointed out that one-third of the infections of the disease were spread by people who did not demonstrate any symptoms. One research says that people infected with the disease may not show symptoms in the initial state. That’s why experts have recommended social distancing and maintaining a distance of six feet from other people.

824,“Lockdown notice issued by the government comes into effect from 6 am Tuesday.” , news_24npllite,"A new coronavirus variant known as ‘Omicron‘ is spreading in various parts of the world including in India. Although Nepal has not detected Omicron cases so far, there are growing fears that countries could impose new lockdowns to stop the new variant from spreading. Amid this situation, some unscrupulous TikTok users have posted video clips claiming that the government has imposed lockdown starting Tuesday.A Tiktok account named news_24npllite, on November 27, 2021 posted a video clip with a superimposed headline that read “Lockdown notice issued by the government comes into effect from 6 am Tuesday.” The 11-second TikTok post has received more than 127,000 reactions and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.

827,Nepali Congress joint-general secretary Prakash Sharan Mahat has claimed that his party’s failure to hold its general convention on time had not created a crisis of legitimacy for the party.,Shilapatra news website ,"Nepali Congress joint-general secretary Prakash Sharan Mahat has claimed that his party’s failure to hold its general convention on time had not created a crisis of legitimacy for theparty.In a video interview published on Shilapatra news website on August 30, Mahat, who is also a former foreign minister, said: “There has never been a crisis of legitimacy [for the Nepali Congress]. [That the political parties should hold their general convention in] five and a half years is just a moral binding [obligation] and other political parties have not been fulfilling this obligation. With regard to Congress, since it is a democratic party, the expectations are higher…”The claim made by Mahat has been found to be false because Nepal’s constitution itself has made it mandatory for political parties to conduct their general conventions on time.Clause 4 (b) of Article 269 states: “A political party’s constitution must provide for election of each of the office bearers of the party at the federal and province levels at least once every five years, but in the event of failure to hold such elections within five years due to special circumstances, the party’s constitution should make a provision to hold such elections within six months.”According to this provision, even after including the additional grace period of six months, Nepali Congress should have organized its 14th convention by September.The party had organized its 13th convention starting March 5, 2016 and the election committee had announced the results on March 19, 2016. So the five years completed on March 19, 2021.Nepali Congress has now decided to organize its ward level conventions from September 3 and the central convention on November 25-29, 2021.The general convention of another major party, the CPN-UML, has also been delayed.Had the party not been merged with the CPN (Maoist Centre) to become Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in May 2018, the CPN-UML’s 9th general convention should have been organized in 2019. But the merger was invalidated by the Supreme Court in March this year and both the parties were restored to their pre-merger statuses.The CPN-UML has decided to organize its 10th national convention on November 26-28, 2021 although the law allows the party to hold the convention by April 2022.Also, Section 16 of the Political Parties Act-2017 states that political parties should conduct the elections of their federal and provincial committees every five years. And if a party is unable to conduct the elections within five years due to special circumstances then it should duly inform the Election Commission and conduct the elections within the next six months.Also, Section 54 of the Political Parties Act-2017 states that any party failing to conduct the elections on time can be subjected to punishments including a fine of up to Rs 50,000 and ban on contesting elections.The aforementioned constitutional and legal provisions show political parties are legally bound to conduct their general conventions on time. Therefore, Nepali Congress joint general secretary Mahat’s claim that parties have just a moral obligation to conduct their general conventions on time is false.",1
828, Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. , Yoho Bahas,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Socialist), a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), speaking on Yoho Bahas program aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli.

Inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed by India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill by parliament.“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years term of the immediate past government led by KP Sharma Oli.",1

837,PM’s suggestion of salt water gargle as home remedy ,South Asia Check,"Addressing the 5th Indradaha Tourism Festival at Dahachowk in the Kathmandu Valley on February 21, 2021, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli repeated an already debunked claim about a home remedy for Covid-19. Oli repeated the claim, which is among several claims that were flagged as false by the World Health Organization’s ‘Myth Busters’ series in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. About a year ago, many international fact-checkers had investigated and debunked a common claim that gargling with saline water or rinsing nose with the solution could prevent one from Covid-19 infection. While repeating the claim on February 21, the prime minister said some people had earlier made fun of him when he had suggested salt water gargle as a remedy.Oli said: “…Covid keeps coming and going. It gets inside the nose and then you just clean it and it will vamoose. Even if it somehow manages to get inside your throat, just gargle with warm salt water, and it will be gone.”",1
838,PM made four claims in two recent speeches,South Asia Check,"Having dissolved the House of Representatives and announcing general elections, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has recently addressed several rallies across the country. In his speeches, Oli defended his government’s move and highlighted its various achievements of the last three years of his tenure, and his previous stint as prime minister. On February 5, 2021, addressing a rally at Durbar Marg in Kathmandu, he said: “Some people have spread various misleading information about me.” But a fact-check of his recent speeches by South Asia Check found that the prime minister himself has been repeating some claims that have already been debunked by fact-checkers.First claim“During the inauguration of the substation (in Dhalkebar) today, I said 111 years ago, in 1911, hydropower was generated in Nepal from the Chandra Jyoti [named after then Rana prime minister Chandra Shumsher] Hydropower Station. Until six years ago, Nepal would not generate even 300 megawatts (MW) in total. Although Nepal was the first South Asian country to generate hydropower, it generated around 3 MW of electricity per year in the 105 years after the first hydropower project. When I became prime minister, the country was seeing 18 hours of power outage daily. But within a week of my prime ministership while addressing a Dashain festival function I announced that the next year’s Tihar festival [festival of lights] will not be celebrated in darkness. So, in order to meet the goal, my government bought electricity from India and [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi Ji and I inaugurated the construction of Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line. ” [Go to 5 mins 15 seconds into the video]Oli made the remarks at a meeting of the Progressive Engineering Association Nepal in Kathmandu on February 1, 2021. Before addressing the February 1 gathering, Oli had inaugurated the Dhalkebar substation, the country’s largest. Although some of Oli’s claims in this statement were true, two claims are false.The 500-kilowatt hydropower station in Pharping on the outskirts of Kathmandu, inaugurated by King Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah when Chandra Shumsher Janga Bahadur Rana was prime minister, is Nepal’s first hydropower project but it was not the first in South Asia.According to the Indian newspaper Times of India, India started operation of a 130-kilowatt hydroelectric project in Darjeeling in 1897. Similarly, India’s first major power station – a 4.5 MW hydropower project on the Cauvery River in Karnataka – was commissioned in 1902. Therefore, it’s wrong to say Nepal’s Chandra Jyoti Hydropower Plant was the first hydroelectricity project in South Asia.
Oli’s another claim is also wrong. He claimed that Nepal generated less than 300 MW of hydroelectricity before his first stint as prime minister in 2015. According to Nepal Electricity Authority’s annual report for 2015/16, Nepal’s installed hydropower capacity at the time was 469.29 MW. Therefore, Oli’s claim that Nepal’s generated less than 300 MW when he first became the prime minister is wrong.Second claim“A so-called Nepal banda (nationwide shutdown) was called yesterday [February 4] in an attempt to prevent you from attending this rally. What did they do to enforce their shutdown? They claim that they work for the poor, but instead of helping the working class, they spilled the vegetables of an elderly roadside woman vendor on the street in their attempt to start a revolution.” [Go to 2 mins 25 seconds into the video]Prime Minister Oli made the remarks while addressing a rally at Durbar Marg in Kathmandu on February 5. Oli was referring to some photos, which had gone viral on the social media and purportedly showed the enforcers of the February 4 shutdown, which was called by the Prachanda-Madhav faction of the Nepal Communist Party, spilling vegetables on the street. An investigation by Nepal Factcheck, a Nepali factchecking website, into the viral photos found that the photos were from a farmers’ protest in the Indian state of Maharashtra and a protest by vegetable farmers in Nepal three years ago. Prime Minister Oli has spread misinformation such as this by repeatedly making claims that have already been debunked by factcheckers.Third claim“The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution. In other words, nowhere it is written that a British prime minister can dissolve parliament. Such thing is not written in any form. But the [British] prime minister recently dissolved parliament and held elections.”Prime Minister Oli made the claim at the February 5 rally at Durbar Marg to defend his dissolution of parliament. It’s true that the UK does not have a written constitution. But it is incorrect to claim that there is no law [in the UK] that allows the prime minister to dissolve parliament. The UK’s Fixed Term Parliaments Act gives the prime minister the power to dissolve parliament under certain conditions.In the UK, there is a separate and written law on the dissolution of parliament. Laws such as the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, and the Parliament Act address major constitutional issues, according to the BBC.According to an explainer published in The Conversation, the tradition in which the prime minister requested the monarch to dissolve the parliament ended in the UK after the country enacted the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in 2011. The idea behind the Act was to curtail the power of the prime minister to dissolve parliament before completing the five-year term. Nevertheless, the Act has made two exceptions:If a motion for an early election is agreed by at least 434 MPs out of 650 (a two-thirds majority), orif a motion of no confidence is passed and no alternative government is formed within 14 days.The latest dissolution of the UK’s Parliament occurred in 2019 and elections were held in December that year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson dissolved the House of Commons in 2019. He had cited the first of the above exceptions to dissolve the House.Fourth claim“In Nepal, the Covid-19 mortality rate is low. The treatment is good. What was the situation like [in the early days of the pandemic]? There’s was no treatment. Today, 82 laboratories simultaneously conduct swab tests for Covid-19 infections every day. Today, people are being vaccinated at more than 300 booths. ” [Go to 26 mins 19 seconds into the video]This remark by the prime minister came as part of his claim that the death toll from Covid-19 has decreased as a result of the measures taken by his government. Although his claim that Covid-19 tests are conducted daily in 82 laboratories is true, the prime minister exaggerated the actual number of vaccination booths. According to the Ministry of Health, on February 1, people were vaccinated from 191 booths in 77 districts. The number of vaccine booths recently reached 201. So, the prime minister’s claim about the booth numbers is a gross overstatement.",1

There was a girl who said she was not included in the [karate] team unfairly and that she would go to South Korea on her own to participate in the games. ‘I can win gold medal but they selected others while excluded me, so I will personally fund the trip,’ she said and she went [to South Korea] and won a gold.”",1

842,Purported government text message about snap curfew,South Asia Check,"In the wee hours of October 19, the cell phones of many people in Nepal beeped with WhatsApp and SMS text messages about a curfew notice. The text message titled ‘Nepal Government Security Portal Notice’ and purportedly sent by “PSC” using bulk SMS service* caused confusion among the receivers. Many users took screenshots of the notice and shared it on Facebook and Twitter. The screenshots shared on social media show that the notice had started circulating from around 1 am on October 19. The message’s purported sender was the PSC, which is commonly understood as the acronym of the Public Service Commission, the human resource agency of the government. However, no such notice was found on the commission’s website.The text message in broken English read:  “There has been sudden issue of emergency curfew. No Netizens are allowed to step out of the house starting immediately until further notice. The Armed Police Force is constantly monitoring air traffic and working towards the neutralization of incoming threats on India-Nepal Borders. Government requests the citizens to be updated with official sources. All services except for Hospitals are shut down until further notice.”Ramesh Thapa, a resident of Manmaiju in Kathmandu, told South Asia Check that he initially got nervous after reading the message on his mobile phone on Monday morning. “At first I thought they might have imposed a curfew amid growing cases of COVID-19. But after pondering over the message, I concluded that the Public Service Commission would not issue a message related to national security. Also the language of the message was a bit unusual so I thought it must be a hoax,” Thapa said.Some social media users have speculated that the government’s bulk SMS system could have been hacked, while others tagged Nepal Police and telecommunications service providers on Twitter, calling for an investigation into the matter.",1

848, on the recent political developments in Nepal after Nepal’s parliament unanimously endorsed a bill to amend the national emblem.,south Asia Check,"In a current affairs show, DNA (Daily News and Analysis), broadcast on July 7 on Indian TV channel Zee News, Sudhir Chaudhary, the show host and the channel’s editor-in chief ,commented on the recent political developments in Nepal after Nepal’s parliament unanimously endorsed a bill to amend the national emblem. This followed the release of arevised political and administrative map by Nepal by including territories in Nepal’s northwestern region, which are currently under Indian occupation. In the context of the actions taken against Janata Samajwadi Party’s member of parliament Sarita Giri, who protested against the new map, Chaudhary said:“A few days ago, Nepal issued a new map claiming three territories of India as its own. And, the map has been endorsed by both the houses of the federal parliament of Nepal. But adecision has been taken to expel the only MP [member of parliament] who opposed the new map from her party and parliament. Sarita Giri is the MP’s name. Sarita Giri is an MP fromthe Samajwadi Party of Nepal. Sarita Giri’s fault was that she protested against the new map. And, she argued there is no basis for including Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura, and Kalapani of India in the map of Nepal. But the government of Nepal couldn’t accept this fact, for which Sarita Giri had to lose her position as a punishment for speaking the truth.”The constitution amendment bill to revise the national emblem of Nepal to include Limpiyadhura, Kalapani, and Lipulekh in the map was passed by both houses of the federal parliament and ratified by the president on June 18. As it was a matter of national sovereignty, the government, the main opposition, and all parties voted in favor of the revised map. But Janata Samajwadi Party MP Sarita Giri had openly protested against the issue. She opposed the new map stating that Nepal, before issuing the revised map, had not communicated with its two neighbors India and China. Also, speaking last month on the “Janata Janna Chanchhan” program on Prime Times TV, she had said that would not accept that Limpiyadhura belongs to Nepal.After the government brought a bill to amend the constitution to change the map of Nepal on the national emblem, Giri had registered an amendment to the government bill. But Speaker Agni Sapkota rejected Giri’s amendment proposal. And the Janata Samajwadi Party took the action against Giri after she refused to withdraw her amendment proposal ignoring the party’s instructions. Stating that Giri had violated the party’s directives and whip, the party formed a three-member inquiry committee on June 22. Mohammad Istiyak Rai, secretary of the Janata Samajwadi Party, said the committee had sought clarification from Giri and submitted a report to the party.

852,Janata Samajwadi Party leader Rajendra Mahato spoke in length about a new constitution amendment bill brought by the government to alter Nepal’s map. ,south Asia Check,"On the ‘Janata Janna Chahanchhan’ program aired on Prime Times Television on May 31, Janata Samajwadi Party leader Rajendra Mahato spoke in length about a new constitution amendment bill brought by the government to alter Nepal’s map. The interview program centered around whether the parliament would unanimously endorse the bill. Mahato said all parties support the new map but he wants a package deal on constitution amendment so as to address the grievances of the Madhesi people.In the course of the interview, Mahato made a few claims.First claim:“During the 1989 economic blockade, [the government] brought kerosene from Bangkok by air.”Toward the end of the Panchayat regime, India had imposed a 15-month-long blockade on Nepal apparently expressing dissatisfaction over Nepal’s purchase of weaponry from China. India announced the blockade right after the expiry of the Nepal-India treaties on trade and transit on March 23, 1989. India shut down 21 border points (10 main points and 11 others) with Nepal. India ended the blockade on July 1, 1990 after the restoration of democracy in Nepal.In an interview published in Nagarik daily on October 5, 2015, Nara Bahadur Budhathoki, who was Nepal’s minister for commerce and supplies during the 1989 blockade, said that India, under pressure from the international community, had allowed Nepal to import fuel from Singapore via Kolkata. A translated version of the Nagarik interview was published in the Nepali Times weekly. In the interview, Budhathoki said Nepal had imported fuel also from Bangladesh during the 1989 blockade. Similarly, a report published by the Nepal Rastra Bank after the 2015 Indian economic blockade also mentioned that Nepal had imported fuel from Singapore and Bangladesh during the 1989 economic blockade.Second claim:“Nature has been benevolent to Nepal. Nepal is world’s second richest country in terms of water resources. But the water has been flowing out of the country for nothing. I mean water dollar, white gold. But Nepalis are growing poorer and poorer.”Mahato’s second claim is also wrong. That Nepal is second richest country in the world in terms of water resources is just a popular myth.",1

Most Twitter and Facebook users have posted the map with the following text:  “The map is from textbook of Grade 8. This must have been published around 2012-13 (BS) because it includes the population of 2011. This map shows Limpiyadhura within Nepal. It must be investigated when did they [leaders] prostrate before India and revised the map. Maybe the honorable members of parliament should pay heed to this.” BS is short for the Bikram Sambat calendar used in Nepal and it is 56.7 years ahead of the Anno Domini (AD) or the Gregorian calendar.On May 12, Matrika Pokharel, a former president of Progressive Writers’ Association, posted a copy of the map along with the aforementioned text on Facebook and this been already been shared 245 times.

854,Sujata Koirala’s statement: “The Kalapani territory belongs to India and should be given to India”. ,south Asia Check,"Nepal’s social media is abuzz with comments and criticism following the news of inauguration of a strategic “link road” connecting India’s Dharchula district with China on May 8. The inauguration of the road, which passes through Lipulekh, a territory claimed by Nepal, was widely reported in the Nepali media. Border disputes between India and Nepal are a recurring phenomenon and whenever a dispute erupts, Nepalis express views with intensely nationalistic fervor on social media. And during such times false and misleading information spreads though the social media platforms. Last week, we fact-checked a viral video involving an anti-India demonstration in Butwal, which was six-months old, but was being shared as if it was new.Video clip of anti-India demonstration is six months oldA video clip featuring Sujata Koirala, a central member of the opposition Nepali Congress party and former deputy prime minister, is being widely circulated on social media since May 13. The video clip with Nepali text reads: “Sujata Koirala says the Kalapani territory belongs to India and should be given to India.” The text and the video clip are being widely shared on Facebook. Two video clips of different lengths (one is 16 seconds long and another 52 seconds long) are being shared on Facebook with similar claims.The 16-second-long video uploaded on May 13 by Facebook user Santosh Kangliba Limbu has already been shared 3,100 times and viewed 161,000 times.

855,KP Sharma Oli wrongly refers to little people of Africa as ‘Lilliput’,online khabar,"CPN-UML chairman and former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, speaking at a function organised by the party’s youth wing National Youth Federation in the capital on September 6, criticised his former party colleagues and the current government. In his almost hour-long speech, Oli attacked the parties in the ruling alliance, particularly the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led splinter group and the Maoists.Oli said, “There’s a tribe in Africa called Lilliput. They are small people. They begin reproduction when they are seven or eight years old. By the age of 15, they become old and stop reproduction.  Most die at the age of 20, and if someone reaches 25, they would be happy just like when we turn 100 years old. [In Africa], there’s a small tribe, which is unique and is called Lilliput.”South Asia Check examined the claim.Oli claimed that there are little people called Lilliput in Africa. But, there is no such tribe called Lilliput.Lilliput in fact is the fictional island nation in Jonathan Swift’s famous novel Gulliver’s Travels, published in 1726. In the novel, Lilliput is home to tiny people called Lilliputians, who are just six inches tall. In Lilliput, it is not only people who are short but the whole environment and infrastructures are tiny, too. In the novel, which the British newspaper The Guardian ranked one of 100 best novels in 2013, Swift, an Irish satirist, chronicles the journey of Lemuel Gulliver, the book’s protagonist. The book does not mention the Lilliputians’ biological characteristics but describes them as smart, selfish and violent people. The novel also features Blefuscudians, inhabitants of another tiny island called Blefuscu. Blefuscudians are the enemies of Lilliputians.Our research found that Oli’s description of the people somewhat matched the Pygmy tribes who live in Africa and Asia. Pygmies are hunter-gatherers and are around five feet tall. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the most known pygmies live in tropical Africa. They live in the jungles of central and west Africa in countries such as Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. Their population is estimated at 120,000.The life expectancy of these people is between 16 and 24 years. As they have short lifespans, their puberty starts early. The pygmies in Asia are commonly known as Negritos. Although he called the small people from Africa ‘Lilliput’, which is a fictitious place, from his description it seems Oli was referring to the Pygmies, who reach reproductive maturity early and have short lifespans.",1
856,Ram Kumari Jhakri’s claim that Oli didn’t bring any Covid-19 vaccine was false,Injina Panthi,"Ram Kumari Jhakri, a politician associated with the proposed Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Socialist, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist, speaking on the Yoho Bahas programme aired on August 18 on Yoho TV falsely claimed that Nepal could not import Covid-19 vaccine during the tenure of the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli. During the interview, she said Prime Minister Oli issued a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal and hastily inaugurated the Dharahara in an attempt to project himself as a nationalist and development-oriented leader. She also claimed that there was no development project that was started and completed during his tenure.She said in the interview, “Show me just one development project that was started and completed during his tenure. Not even the vaccine came. Not even the vaccine, you know….His advisors were tweeting that the 7 million vaccine doses donated by the US to Asia were for Nepal. He would mislead people with such claims and is still trying to do so.”The claim by Jhakri, who is also a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, that no vaccine came during Oli’s tenure is false.Let’s look at the facts.Sher Bahadur Deuba was appointed prime minister on July 13, 2021. On the same day, the Health Ministry issued a report that said altogether 1,828,484 people had received their first dose of the Covishield vaccine and 460,743 people had received the second dose of the vaccine. Likewise, 783,323 people had received their first dose of the Chinese Vero Cell vaccine and 642,396 people had received the second dose of the vaccine, according to the report.The Oli government rolled out a vaccination campaign seven months ago. The campaign kicked off after Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, the then director of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, received the first jab of Covishield on January 27.According to the Health Ministry, on January 21, 2021, India donated 1 million doses of the Covishield vaccine to the Nepal government and 100,000 doses of the vaccine to the Nepal Army.In early 2021, Nepal struck a deal with India’s Serum Institute to procure 2 million doses of Covishield. Though 1 million doses arrived on February 21, 2021, the Indian company failed to send the remaining shipment, dealing a blow to the country’s vaccination drive.As Nepal scrambled for vaccines, China stepped in providing 1.8 million doses of the Vero Cell vaccine produced by Chinese company Sinopharm. In late March, Nepal received 800,000 doses of Vero Cell.In early June, the Chinese government sent an additional 1 million doses of the Vero Cell vaccine. Similarly, under the Covax program, a UN-backed scheme to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, Nepal received 304,800 doses of the Covishield vaccine. The US government also donated over 1.5 million doses of the single-dose Janssen vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson.In June, the Nepal government struck a deal to buy 4 million doses of Vero Cell with Sinopharm, with the first consignment arriving on July 21, 2021. The deal was struck by the Oli government.Although the Astrazeneca vaccine Japan donated to Nepal arrived on August 7, after Deuba was appointed the prime minister, the country had announced the delivery a month earlier. The Japanese-donated jabs were administered to the elderly who had not received the second dose after the Indian company failed to deliver Covishield vaccines to Nepal.Therefore, Jhakri’s claim that Nepal did not receive Covid-19 vaccines during former Prime Minister Oli’s tenure is false.

857,Commentator Saurabh falsely claims a 1958 postage stamp had a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal,South Asia Check,"Writer and political commentator Saurabh speaking on the Tamasoma Jyotirgamaya programme aired on AP1 television on July 19 claimed that a postage stamp issued by the Nepal government in 1958 features a Nepal map with a pointed spur on the northwestern corner.He made the claim in the context of the immediate past government issuing a new map of Nepal last year by including Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas within the Nepali territory. The inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed by India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill by parliament.“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But, the Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years’ term of the immediate past government led by KP Sharma Oli.South Asia Check examined the claim.Likewise, a ticket issued in February 1959 to mark the first general elections has the national flag and Nepal map, but the map does not have the pointed spur. Other postage stamps issued in the same year do not have the Nepal map.In 1954, a map series of postage stamps was issued featuring the map of Nepal, but none contains the pointed spur.This information is from the publication titled “Nepal Postage Stamp Catalogue 1881-2015.” We also spoke to the president of Nepal Philatelic Society, Shankar Shrestha, who corroborated the aforementioned information. Therefore, writer Saurabh’s claim that the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS featured a ‘pointy map’ of Nepal is false.",1
858,"Some Nepali social media users shared 5G increases Covid-19 cases. But, it’s baseless"," Deepak Adhikari
","A false claim about 5G, which is the fifth generation of wireless telephony, is circulating among social media users in Nepal. The claim along with photos of anti-5G protests says Nepal has fewer Covid-19 cases because it has not rolled out the 5G technology; the pandemic is surging in India due to the 5G radiation and the death rates are high in the Indian states where the technology has been launched.

A Pokhara-based photographer and disk jockey, Ohm Lama, shared the post and photos on Facebook on May 9. His post has been shared by more than 4,500 people.

The post reads as follows:

“Since Nepal has not yet launched 5G, Covid cases are fewer here. And, even the existing Covid cases here were caused by the radiation from 5G in India. In India, wherever 5G services have started, the death rates have been rising. For example, 5G testing is currently underway in Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka. And, in the surrounding areas, people have shown various symptoms such as burning sensation and redness in eyes, dry throat, excessive thirst, breathing difficulties, etc.”The same content has been shared on Facebook here, here and here. The claim includes photographs of the anti-5G protests in London of the UK and in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.Last year, similar claims had gone viral in various European countries including the United Kingdom. India’s Alt News and Factly have also fact-checked such claims.Now, South Asia Check has investigated the false claim, which is currently circulating among Nepalis.5G is the most advanced technology for mobile phones. The fifth-generation technology will radically change the way people use the internet in their life. Madhu Sudan Dahal, a senior telecommunications engineer at Nepal Telecom, tells South Asia Check that 4G service is currently available in Nepal and 5G is only being tested. 5G is a more advanced technology than 4G, Dahal says. In order to operate 5G, telecom companies need to update and upgrade hardware (such as antennas) and software, according to him.While it is true that mobile phones spread electromagnetic waves, various studies have shown them to be harmless, the telecom engineer says. “People may have been misled by the fact that both the electromagnetic waves the mobile phone generates and the coronavirus are invisible,” he says. “The electromagnetic waves cause no harm.”Here is how the frequency of mobile telephony works, according to him: “When we speak over a mobile phone, our voice is picked up by the nearest tower via waves. It then reaches the server of the telecommunications service provider, which in turn sends it to the nearest tower to the person we are calling. The tower that gives the best signal transmits my voice.”In order to provide high-speed internet via 5G, telecom service providers install many small cell sites to poles, walls or towers (unlike previous networks, which used huge towers), according to experts In India, telecom companies including Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have tested the 5G technology in various cities, but they are yet to roll out the service for consumers. While it is true that the Indian states mentioned in the Facebook post had seen a surge in Covid-19 cases in India, the claim that the 5G technology is being tested in those states is wrong.In its fact sheet published last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the coronavirus does not spread through 5G mobile networks. “Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks,” the WHO said.Before the launch of 5G in the UK last year, the Chinese mobile company Huawei, which is involved in building the 5G infrastructure, faced rumours that it would spy on the mobile users, so this time some people might have used the coronavirus to spread misinformation about the 5G technology, according to Dahal, the telecom engineer. “People suspected that the government could use the technology for the surveillance of its citizens,” he says.

859,"Viral on Nepal social media, ‘home remedy’ for boosting blood oxygen levels is unfounded"," Deepak Adhikari
","As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages in Nepal, people have been sharing various kinds of information related to the disease including some supposed home remedies on social media platforms. One such social media post accompanied by a picture suggesting a traditional remedy for low blood oxygen levels has been widely shared on Twitter andFacebook.The post reads as follows: “Take three-four cubes of camphor, three-four cloves, a teaspoon of carom seeds and two-three drops of eucalyptus oil, wrap up the mixture in a piece of soft cotton cloth and sniff it from time to time. [Every time] after sniffing, put the pouch back into a Ziploc bag. If Eucalyptus oil is not available, you can do without it.”On April 26, Rama Singh, a former news anchor of the state-run Nepal Television, shared a picture along with the message on her Facebook page. Facebook users have thanked Singh for the information. One user also shared a Hindi-language video clip with instructions for preparing and using the remedy. Singh’s post has received 30 responses and more than 4,000 shares on Facebook. The post along the picture has been shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook. The post had gone viral in India. In Nepal, it appears that many social media users have shared Singh’s post.South Asia Check found the supposed remedy is misleading and baseless.According to Prakash Gyawali, a doctor of traditional Ayurveda medicine, although camphor, cloves and carom seeds are natural ingredients used in traditional remedies, the claim that their use boosts blood oxygen levels in humans is unfounded. “The Ayurveda hasn’t described these items as medicines. In order for something to be an Ayurvedic medicine, it has to be mentioned in the related literature,” Gyawali tells South Asia Check.Camphor helps open the nose in case of cold while cloves dry the phlegm, Gyawali says. “Carom seed is also mixed in various medicines. If you have chest problems, it is used because of its expectorant or drying properties,” he says.A mix of eucalyptus oil and herbs can be used to relieve cough symptoms, according to him. “It can be used as a nasal decongestant. It makes it easier to breathe, but there is no evidence that it raises oxygen levels,” he says.Dr Pushpa Mani Kharal, the medical superintendent at Mulpani Municipal Hospital in Kathmandu, says there is no evidence that using the herbs would increase the blood oxygen level. “To increase the oxygen level, your lungs have to be healthy. Or oxygen should be given artificially,” Kharal tells South Asia Check.“There are other ways such as lying in a prone position (sleeping on your knees and belly), deep breathing, etc. These exercises can make breathing easier,” he says.Also, we did an extensive search on Google, but could not find any reliable information to support the claim that the aforementioned mixture boosts blood oxygen levels. You can read about the benefits of camphor and clove on WebMD, a US-based publisher of health-related information.Based on the statements of the two doctors and other references, the widely shared claim that the use of a mix of camphor, clove, carom seeds and eucalyptus oil increases the oxygen level is misleading and baseless.

861,Old photos of foreign fires being circulated as Nepal wildfire photos,Sanjog Shiwakoti,"Nepal’s major cities including Kathmandu and Pokhara are blanketed by the smoke from the raging wildfires across the country over the last few days. In the absence of strong winds, the smog remains suspended over the Nepali sky. On March 26, Kathmandu was ranked the world’s most polluted city, by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company. The severe air pollution has forced the government to close schools in many districts including the capital, Kathmandu, for four days. Flights to and from Kathmandu and other airports have been suspended or diverted due to poor visibility.Social media users have taken to Twitter and Facebook to draw the world’s attention to the disaster. On March 31, the #PrayforNepal hashtag trended on Twitter. Social media users have shared various pictures of the wildfires. The photos have been shared here, here on Twitter and here, here on Facebook. But we found that some of these photos are misleading. They were from other countries.South Asia Check has fact-checked four of the photos circulating on social media.So, it is now clear that the social media users shared misleading photos of wildfires from the US, Canada and Indonesia portraying them as Nepal’s photos.",1
862,Old photo photoshopped to show Indian flag in February 10 demonstration,online khabar,"On February 10, a faction of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal organised a demonstration in Kathmandu against the dissolution of the House of Representatives.The demonstration got a lot of coverage, both on mainstream media and social media. Among the photos, one photo went viral. The photo shows an Indian flag among the NCP party flags held by demonstrators. Some online news outlets also published reports claiming that the Indian flag was also used in the demonstration.South Asia Check examined the photo and the claim.Janata Times Online published a news report headlined ‘Indian flag in demonstration led by Prachanda-Madhav, anti-Nepal scheme exposed’. But the outlet later corrected the news and changed its headline as “Indian flag in demonstration led by Prachanda-Madhav!”.The outlet apologised saying it got misled and also published the original photo, which does not contain the Indian flag.Similarly, Chakrapath Online published a report with the photo under the headline: ‘Indian flag used in demonstration organised by Prachanda-Madhav!’A Twitter handle called @iambishalbhatta tweeted the photo along with this text: “In the demonstration organized by the Prachanda-Madhav faction in Kathmandu, someone was found waving Indian flag and chanting slogans against Prime Minister KP Oli.”The photo has been retweeted 61 times.  Similarly, the photo with the same text shared by Bishal Bhatta on Facebook has been shared 161 times.The photo shared by Twitter handle @khadga_acharya has been retweeted 13 times.Similarly, Ganesh Basnet shared a  link of Janata Times news on Facebook. His post has been shared 652 times. Many users have also shared the photo on a public Facebook group called Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Fact check: South Asia Check ran a ‘reverse image search’ of the photo and found that the original photo was published almost a month and a half ago by the Nepali-language daily Annapurna Post on its website along with a report of the December 29, 2020 protest rally organized by the Dahal-Nepal faction of the Nepal Communist Party.The photo does not contain the Indian flag. It was published under the headline ‘NCP’s protest against the dissolution of parliament (photo feature)’.The photos are credited to Uma Bista and Sunita Dangol.

863,‘Red mercury’ claims on social media just a hoax,online khabar,"Over the past few days, social media users in Nepal have posted photos and statuses along with claims that old TV and radio sets that purportedly contain a substance called “re d mercury” would fetch fortunes.“Old TV and radio sets contain red mercury, which costs tens of millions of rupees a gram. Check it out on YouTube,” read Facebook user Mayur Shrestha’s post.Commenting on a Twitter thread, Sadiksha Karki wrote, “Philips (a Dutch multinational company) is itself looking for the substance. Because the substance used in the radio is rare, a team from Germany is visiting Nepal and India (in search of it).”On Facebook posts, most users have responded to the offer claiming they have it. While some users have asked those claiming to possess the substance to inbox [send private messages on social media] their contact details.What is “red mercury”?Contrary to what is being portrayed on social media platforms, red mercury is not a hidden treasure but a source of countless rumours and myths that have persisted for decades. Though it is shrouded in mystery, with its existence unproven yet, the myths around it have thrived since the Cold War. In a 2019 article, the BBC said adverts and video offering “red mercury” for sale were found online. In 2015, The New York Times Magazine published a long-form report by war correspondent CJ Chivers with the headline: The Doomsday Scam. The New York Times’ story details how the ISIS fighters embarked on the quest to find red mercury.What can be deduced from these articles is that con artists in several countries have used this dubious substance to swindle the unsuspecting public. In 2007, scientific journal Science Direct published a research paper titled ‘Analysis of an Object Assumed to Contain Red Mercury’. The study also found no red mercury in the samples the researchers had collected.According to the UK-based risk assessment and intelligence firm S-RM, red mercury is not thought to exist outside of conspiracy theories, though US physicist Samuel Cohen had claimed it existed. Mercury is a substance used to make nuclear weapons. This substance, like lead, can hold a large amount of heat. It is also used for medicinal purposes.In India since September, rumours about red mercury have been spreading through social media platforms and YouTube channels. Claims that it was worth tens of thousands of rupees went viral on Hindi-language websites and digital platforms. India’s fact-checking website Factly has debunked the rumour.In Nepal, people have shared photos and text about red mercury on a Facebook group called ‘Nepali Purano Paisa’ which has more than 57,000 users. The Facebook group shares posts about old coins and banknotes. Users have posted photos of a small bottle with red liquid. Various users have said that they have it or are willing to buy it.We spoke to Basant Giri, a scientist at Kathmandu Institute of Applied Sciences about this. “It looks like a hoax circulating around for decades across the globe,” he told South Asia Check. “There’s no such chemical or material called red mercury.” He said the red-coloured liquid may just be “red dye” or some mercury compound which does not have a “special” price as such. “Rather, most of the mercury compounds are toxic,” he said. “The old electronic devices contain some heavy metals such as lead and others. The heavy metals, which are toxic, can be recycled, but are not precious,” he said.

864,"When there are many ‘experts’ spreading unverified information, everyone has to protect themselves from infodemic",online khabar,"On September 7, Kathmandu police arrested Subas Subba Limbu on the charge of accusing doctors involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients of removing organs of Covid-19 victims. He was one among several self-claimed ‘experts’ who were busy giving interviews to YouTube channels about the coronavirus and Covid-19.The presence of such experts on YouTube and other social media platforms have turned this pandemic into an infodemic. There are many people around you who are claiming that Covid-19 is not a pandemic at all, this is just a scam run by the medical corporate mafia including the WHO. There are many conspiracy theories alike such as the one claimed by Limbu.As per the Nepal Twitter Users Survey conducted by the Centre for Media Research-Nepal in November last year, 95% of Nepali internet users are exposed to disinformation. Apparently, the flow of such unverified information and false information has increased amidst the pandemic.However, controlling this flow is next to impossible. There come questions of freedom of expression and speech. In today’s world, no one can stop anyone from expressing their opinions as at the heart of democracy lies the freedom of speech. Neither can police or concerned authorities arrest or take legal actions on hundreds of them.So, how can the confused mass look at the issue? Experts of different fields suggest the public, the media, and the government have their own shares of responsibilities.Kundan Aryal, a media educator at Central Department of Journalism and Mass Communication in Tribhuvan University, thinks the government cannot control such activities, but the mainstream media have to be responsible to ensure the free flow of right information.“From the lens of freedom of speech, we do not look too much into the role of the government. rather we look for the role of the media. It is their responsibility to not confuse the public or mislead them.”For Aryal, this problem is also related to the idea of media literacy. In many countries where the rate of media literacy is high, audience members themselves critically judge what and how much to believe and what and how much not, and filter the contents of the media. However, this is not the case here.Aryal believes that each individual has their own filter by which they verify or evaluate the media contents by using their knowledge, wisdom, and experience. The major basis for their verification can be by questioning the credibility of the media via which such contents are coming.Likewise, journalist Shree Ram Paudel, also another faculty member of the department, shares, “While consuming any type of media content, the audience needs to be aware and have the capacity to filter them. Media literacy plays a great part here.”Further, he explains, “If we see this from a practical approach, there are two types of news, one that should be given to the public by finding them, and the other type of information is generally searched by the public themselves. During the period of the pandemic, both types should be considered. And, For those who cannot critically filter or are not media literate, the government should be responsible to provide the truthful information.”But, before the government, it is the ‘mainstream’ media’s responsibility to provide truthful information to the people as the rate of media literacy is very low in Nepal, Aryal suggests.
To be precise, what mainstream media can do in this case is that they need to inform the people that some misleading contents are also being circulated around them and making them aware of why it is misleading. The media should help their audiences judge the media contents, according to him.Aryal says the mainstream media should come forward to include controversial issues to clear doubts among the public. Noting that there are many issues that the mainstream media do not talk about, but social media users including YouTube channels are exaggerating, he says the mainstream media also need to conduct “full-fledged discussions” on such conflicting and confusing issues and make people aware.Likewise, Paudel says the communicators, who create contents, should also be responsible, “You yourself should be responsible while using your right to freedom of expression. Everyone as a citizen has the right to speak in the matter of public concern. However, if the matter is technical, it is always better that technicians or experts in that sector speak, but the experts should update their knowledge regularly.”Paudel advises further, “They need to present their ideas with sufficient reasoning and facts. Experts should put forward their views, being truthful and with a lot of reasoning. They also need to consider the seriousness of the situation, for example during this pandemic.”Regarding the role of mainstream media, Aryal and Paudel have slightly different views. Aryal thinks the mainstream media have an opportunity to prove why there still exists the significance of a media organisation in our society even when there are social media and other forms of new media. But, Paudel also thinks the pandemic might have crippled the efficiency of the “mainstream” media also.“It is no secret that there has been a huge economic impact on the media industry due to this pandemic that has forced them to limit the human resources and the area of the reporting.”But, Aryal believes when and where responsible and authentic media outlets come forward actively, there will be no place for false, confusing and misleading contents.Aryal predicts that there could emerge chaos if there comes a situation in which people start believing each and every content given to them by any media.Corroborating with Aryal, retired Nepal Police DIG Hemanta Malla Thakuri also thinks the dominance of misinformation could also be a security threat in the future.“The concept of security threat is way beyond what we generally understand. Generally, we take protests, robberies, fights, and these things as a security threat. There exists many security threats such as medical or health security threats, environmental security threats, and many more.”As a possible solution to this issue, Thakuri suggests that the government should take the lead and give easy and truthful information to the public, repeatedly on a daily basis so that the general public has a clear view of this.Paudel also shares a similar opinion regarding the role of government in this issue, also criticising the government for failing to play this role. He puts forward, “Rather than giving priority to the pandemic, the engagement of the government is mostly seen within the ruling party’s internal conflicts. The density of the flow of information by the government (as it just gives an update every 24 hours) is not enough to actually clear all the doubts and confusions.”Additionally, he recommends, “In this situation where the public is so confused, concerned authorities that include the Ministry of the Health and Population and other mechanisms under this ministry, should come to the frontline and clarify repeatedly on a regular basis.”Why keeping people safe from false information and rumours is importantIn the world of social media where a way to control the flow of information is rare, except self-censorship, the flooding of multiple views on one particular issue is not strange.According to psychologist Basu Acharya, the flooding of misinformation or disinformation is bound to arouse irritation and anger among the confused public. This may also induce a serious mental problem called acute stress disorder, leading to trauma.Acharya asks those who are speaking or making claims on such sensitive matters without even calculating the impacts of their views on the general public to be mindful of what they are sharing. But, he implies, it is the public’s, the consumers’ responsibility, to protect themselves from any disaster.

865,‘Naturopath’ who accused docs of removing organs from Covid-19 victims arrested,online khabar,"Police in Kathmandu have arrested a man on the charge of accusing doctors involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients of removing organs of Covid-19 victims.The arrestee has been identified as Subas Subba Limbu, who claimed himself to be a naturopath and gave interviews to various YouTube channels.A team deployed from the Metropolitan Crime Division arrested Limbu on the charge of spreading false information on Monday morning. The division’s chief SSP Deepak Kumar Thapa says he was arrested at an Ayurved clinic located at Dholahity of Lalitpur.A team deployed from the Metropolitan Police Circle, Satdobato, had also arrested him a few days ago.In various YouTube interviews, Subba had claimed bodies of the patients dying of  Covid-19 are not given to the families, neither are sent for an autopsy because the doctors remove various organs from them. The police say publishing this claim amounts to a crime because the claim has not been proven by any evidence.

However, they say four of the news channels will still remain blocked until the next decision.A meeting of the operators held on Sunday decided to continue blocking Zee News, Aaj Tak, India TV, and ABP News only, according to Dish Home Managing Director Supeep Acharya.Owing to the channels’ baseless reporting of Nepal’s decision to issue the country’s new political map and Chinese Ambassador’s engagements  with political leaders here, the cable operators had decided to block their broadcasting owing to the public pressure.The government did not take any decision about blocking the channels but thanked the cable operators for their decision.

867,‘TU psychologist’ makes several false claims in popular YouTube interview,online khabar,"The YouTube channel of Himal Online TV on April 14, 2020, uploaded an interview with Nabin Joshi, referred to as a psychologist in a video entitled “Pahilo Patak Bistrit Khulasa, Jannuhos Adrisya Khel, K Ho Bastabikta?” [Detailed revelation for the first time, know about the hidden game and the reality]. The video is trending in Nepal and is currently trending as number 11 on Youtube. It has already been viewed more than 180,600 times until Tuesday afternoon.In the interview, Nabin Joshi speaks in length about COVID-19 and makes several claims. The interviewer hasn’t provided information about Joshi other than that he is a psychologist. According to Joshi’s Facebook page, he has a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Tribhuvan University (TU). Many people have also reacted to the video that Joshi shared on Facebook.South Asia Check has examined eight of his claims.First claim:“About 25,000 to 56,000 people die each year from influenza-like illness. These deaths occur due to season change.”A report published by the World Health Organization (WHO), on December 14, 2017, states: “Up to 650,000 deaths annually are associated with respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza, according to new estimates by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization and global health partners.”Similarly, a report last reviewed on January 8, 2020, by the CDC has estimated that 34,200 people died during the 2018-2019 influenza season.On the basis of these facts, Joshi’s claim is false.Second claim:“According to an Italian government website, among the people whose deaths were associated with the coronavirus, 48.5% died from other three illnesses. 25.6% died from two other illnesses, and 25.1% of people died from 1 other illness. These other illnesses included heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and pneumonia. Among the dead, some people already had two illnesses, some already had three or more and some had only one. This report says when their swabs were tested using real-time PCR test kits that showed false positive for coronavirus. However, it says the cause of the deaths were other illnesses. It says 0.8 percent of the dead had no other illnesses and this means influenza or seasonal flu was responsible for 0.8% deaths.”The graph Joshi showed was taken from Bloomberg News and Bloomberg had analyzed the graphs prepared from Italy National Health Institute’s report. The analysis presented by Joshi in the video contradicts the analysis prepared by Bloomberg just below the graph. The Bloomberg analysis states, “The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.

More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”

The analysis does not state that the deaths occurred due to hypertension, diabetes or heart disease. Neither does it mention that the deaths occurred due to other illnesses. The report only analysed 18% of Italian COVID-19 deaths and whether the victims had pre-existing illnesses.

Joshi has given misleading information by misinterpreting the facts in the Bloomberg report.

Third claim:

“Its [PCR test kit’s] inventor was Kary B Mullis. He received the Nobel Prize for inventing this test kit 27 years ago. Since that time, WHO hasn’t recognized this kit for diagnostic purposes. Nobody used the kit for the past 27 years but it is being used now.”The first part of his claim is true. American biochemist Kary B Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993 for inventing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.But the second part of his claim is false. A report published by WHO on April 29, 2003 states, “WHO encourages each country to designate a reference laboratory for investigation and/ or referral of specimens from possible SARS patients. Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict criteria.”Similarly, WHO established a WHO working group on PCR protocols for detecting subtype influenza A viruses in 2007 to serve as an expert technical group to provide guidance to WHO on the use of PCR in the context of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).As the PCR method is used for many other purposes Joshi’s claim is inaccurate.Fourth claim:“When reports of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan came on December 31, the WHO said there was no reason to panic. But after 6-7 days, on January 8, the WHO held a meeting and said the virus is very aggressive and it’s a pandemic.”A disease outbreak news update published by the WHO on January 12, 2020, stated that the coronavirus was only seen in Wuhan and detailed investigations were ongoing.On January 13, 2020, officials confirmed a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.It is only on March 11, 2020, that the WHO declared COVID-19 as the pandemic.Based on the facts above, Joshi’s claim is false.Fifth claim:“Nine years ago today, in 2011, the European Union declared that the WHO was a robber organization.”South Asia Check could not find any such report on the internet. The media would have reported if such a serious accusation had been made by the European Union.But there are other reports and news items that provide the basis for dismissing Joshi’s claim.In 2011, the WHO, the EU, and other European countries had jointly published a report entitled “Migration and Health in the European Union” and the report has no mention of such an accusation.Similarly, in the report titled “Everything you always wanted to know about the European Union health policies but were afraid to ask” published in 2014, we found no mention of such an accusation.In addition, in September 2012, the “Health 2020: the European policy for health and well-being” framework signed by the European Union’s 53 member states also has no mention of such an accusation.In The New York Times and Science Magazine, some committees and experts have published critical views of the WHO’s response to the swine flu pandemic but these also do not contain the accusation claimed by Joshi.So, this claim is also false.Sixth claim:“It is meaningless to say that wearing a mask protects you. Mask does not protect people.”These figures also confirm that Joshi’s claim is false.

868,Fake news during Covid-19 crisis may lead kids to trauma. Here’s what psychologists have to say,online khabar,"Shivam Raj Bhandari, eight, is constantly exposed to social media mainly Facebook and YouTube. Recently, he came across one of the viral posts on Facebook that suggested that the novel coronavirus would not affect Nepalis as their immunity power was believed to be the strongest. The post influenced him and he became careless about following the preventive measures against the infection.Fortunately, he has a habit of discussing whatever he sees on social media and he asked his mother, “Is this true, mummy? As we are Nepalis, will we really not get infected by the virus? Can I go out and play with my friends now?  Will it be fine if I don’t frequently wash my hands or sanitise them?”Listening to all these, his mother clarified, “That is not true, my son. We have to follow all the preventive measures like staying at home, not touching our faces, frequently sanitising our hands and washing them with soaps to avoid contracting the Covid-19.” As an obedient son, he listened, understood and has been following this accordingly.Psychologists working with the children’s issue observe that there are many cases like Bhandari’s. However, all the children will not have ‘clarifying’ moms like him. Hence, with easy access to the information spread all over the internet, the children, not matured enough to judge what is right and wrong, are more vulnerable to physical and psychological issues during such trying times, they claim, adding the children need proper care during such period.What are the probable problems?Psychologist Basu Acharya fears that many children in Nepal are likely to experience the same kind of trauma now as they did after the 2015 earthquake.Children can be traumatised with misinformation circulating in and around the virtual as well as the real world, he explains, adding because the information may arouse them the fear of death, of themselves, their parents or the loved ones. It may haunt their psyche completely and give birth to psychological problems like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and other phobias.In this case, imagines Acharya, children may develop separation anxiety disorder—the fear of separation from home and/or from people whom they are strongly emotionally attached with (parents, caregiver, siblings or other significant people), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic attacks and disorder, addiction of mobile phone leading to adjustment disorder, as well as mood swings.As of now, Acharya says, however, he has not encountered such cases in children due to the havoc created by Covid-19 pandemic and its (mis)information flow.Corroborating Acharya, Sajeena Dhungana, who also works with children as a psychotherapist and counselor, asserts that the current situation, in particular the prevalence of misinformation about the infection and its impact, may lead the children to anxiety, panic attacks, and depressive symptoms. “They may express it through their restlessness, tantrums, nagging, fighting, shouting back and also crying. They may not let anyone go out of the home or make a huge fuss about it.”“They might isolate themselves unnecessarily and also do a lot of hand washing. They might wear masks and use sanitisers even when it is not necessary. Some children ask their parents for updates every time. They will show different behaviours according to their age and their understanding of the news.”Also, she clarifies that it takes a lot of time to become a mental problem, but parents or guardians have to be careful about such behaviours of their children.Who can solve them?Both Acharya and Dhungana believe that mainly parents, guardians, elder siblings, primary caregivers, grandparents, and other family members can be members of the children’s first and foremost support system in preventing them from being traumatised and fearful from the misinformation catered about this new disease.Acharya also states that the role of experts, media and government is also equally essential for making children aware of this pandemic with the right information and effective policies. One of the preventive steps Dhungana suggests is to keep the children away from the constant news updates to lessen the effect.Her next recommendation is to utilise the time at hand and engage them in age-appropriate activities and teach them some necessary household chores like cleaning, cooking, and working around the house. At the same time, she suggests, parents can teach children some life skills like creative and critical thinking, as well as arts and crafts. There are lots of do-it-yourself tools that can be experimented with. Books, painting, and drawings are helpful.Dhungana points out, “It is very crucial for the parents to check their mental well-being. If the parents consume with so many news and updates, it will directly affect the children. But saying, ‘I can beat coronavirus and it’s not going to touch us’ is stupid. The parents should focus on informing and involving children in precautionary measures without overwhelming them.”“Instead of pressurising or threatening them to follow preventive measures, the parents should come up with creative strategies, in which children willingly and happily engage and adopt the preventive measures,” Acharya recommends.To prevent their addiction to mobile phones during lockdown and self-isolation, they recommend that the parents should design and involve children in mindful and alternative entertaining indoor games, focusing more on flourishing their hobbies and talents.What are the remedies?Acharya suggests that trusting credible news media and filtering news for truthful information about the disease and avoiding unnecessary discussions, especially misinformation or false claims or myths about the Covid-19, can be very beneficial.Similarly, Dhungana advises that talking about the virus with the right information could be one thing and also asking what they know about the virus and what preventive measures are could be another. “It’s necessary to supervise them while they are watching TV, reading newspapers and scrolling other social media platforms as they might be absorbing the hyped and fake news. So, the family first needs to follow the right media to get the information and impart their knowledge to their kids.Simultaneously, they add, it is very important to use age-appropriate language while giving them honest and detailed answers about their queries about this viral disease. It will be more effective if these answers are coming either from experts or someone in the family whom a child trusts the most.Dhungana proposes, “If the child is found exposed to the misleading information about coronavirus, it is very essential to find out the sources of the message, and correct the information in front of them. Unnecessary exposure to news and media has to be stopped immediately not only for children but for everyone.”During other vacations, children enjoy going to the zoo, fun parks, swimming, cinema halls, and other entertainment spots. But as of now, everything has been shut down. How can children accommodate these circumstances? How can parents make appropriate use of this time especially when both parents and children are locked within their house?In response, Dhungana believes that this is the time when parents really need to be both parents and teachers. She asserts, “Talking and explaining what is social distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine should be the most important thing they should do in a way that they would not feel pressured. Also, this decreases their demand to have their dream vacation or a day-out.”Both of them suggest that parents should be creative and provide healthy, creative, engaging indoor games for children instead of TV and YouTube all the time. There are a lot of audio and visual learning materials online that are easily accessible; that can help.Even then doing all the things might not be enough for some. In that case, they need to find a professional who would guide them to help them in settling the children. Sometimes it’s difficult for the parents to talk about death and loss, at that time, reaching out to a professional is necessary.

869,COVID-19: What’s circulating on social media and what are the facts,online khabar,"Nepal government has introduced emergency measures such as closures of schools and colleges, imposed a ban on a gathering of over 25 people and arrival restrictions for passengers from Europe, the Middle East, Gulf countries, Malaysia, Turkey, South Korea, and Japan to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Misinformation and false claims about the pandemic, however, continue to spread especially through social media. We have examined several such claims being circulated among the users of social media in Nepal.Does gargling with warm water with salt or vinegar cure COVID-19?A meme circulating on Facebook and other social media platforms claim that gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar can eliminate COVID-19. It claims that after the virus reaches the throat, it remains there for four days and causes coughing and throat pain.While Nepalis have traditionally used the solution as a domestic remedy for throat pain and coughing, there’s no evidence that it cures coronavirus. According to the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gargling with warmed water mixed with salt/vinegar helps soothe a sore throat, but there’s no proof that it eliminates coronavirus.Does rinsing your nose with saline water help prevent COVID-19?It’s a misleading claim. It’s true that it can help people recover from the common cold, but it’s not a cure for the coronavirus. Debunking the myth, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said: “There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.”Can COVID-19 coronavirus survive on the surface of iron for 12 hours? A YouTube channel called Official Khabar posted a video claiming that coronavirus can survive for 12 hours on the surface of the iron. Though other tips the video has offered appeared to be accurate, this one is misleading.According to a research paper authored by scientists from the National Institute of Health and published in New England Journal of Medicine, the virus could be detected in aerosols and on surfaces ranging from a few hours to several days.  “We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel,” the report said.Will warm temperature help reduce the spread of the coronavirus?With the end of winter, the temperature is rising across Nepal. Claims that the rise of temperature above 30 degrees Celsius would help reduce the virus are being circulated on social media.But this claim is unsubstantiated. “Because the impact of influenza reduces with the onset of summer, many people seem to believe that it will help reduce the novel coronavirus from spreading during summer. As its name suggests, this is a new virus and we don’t have any evidence to support such a conclusion,” Pushpa Mani Khanal, a medical doctor, told South Asia Check.What latest researches say about COVID-19?The latest scientific researches on coronavirus have pointed out that one-third of the infections of the disease were spread by people who did not demonstrate any symptoms. One research says that people infected with the disease may not show symptoms in the initial state. That’s why experts have recommended social distancing and maintaining a distance of six feet from other people.

877,Nepali Congress joint-general secretary Prakash Sharan Mahat has claimed that his party’s failure to hold its general convention on time had not created a crisis of legitimacy for the party.,Shilapatra news website ,"Nepali Congress joint-general secretary Prakash Sharan Mahat has claimed that his party’s failure to hold its general convention on time had not created a crisis of legitimacy for theparty.In a video interview published on Shilapatra news website on August 30, Mahat, who is also a former foreign minister, said: “There has never been a crisis of legitimacy [for the Nepali Congress]. [That the political parties should hold their general convention in] five and a half years is just a moral binding [obligation] and other political parties have not been fulfilling this obligation. With regard to Congress, since it is a democratic party, the expectations are higher…”The claim made by Mahat has been found to be false because Nepal’s constitution itself has made it mandatory for political parties to conduct their general conventions on time.Clause 4 (b) of Article 269 states: “A political party’s constitution must provide for election of each of the office bearers of the party at the federal and province levels at least once every five years, but in the event of failure to hold such elections within five years due to special circumstances, the party’s constitution should make a provision to hold such elections within six months.”According to this provision, even after including the additional grace period of six months, Nepali Congress should have organized its 14th convention by September.The party had organized its 13th convention starting March 5, 2016 and the election committee had announced the results on March 19, 2016. So the five years completed on March 19, 2021.Nepali Congress has now decided to organize its ward level conventions from September 3 and the central convention on November 25-29, 2021.The general convention of another major party, the CPN-UML, has also been delayed.Had the party not been merged with the CPN (Maoist Centre) to become Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in May 2018, the CPN-UML’s 9th general convention should have been organized in 2019. But the merger was invalidated by the Supreme Court in March this year and both the parties were restored to their pre-merger statuses.The CPN-UML has decided to organize its 10th national convention on November 26-28, 2021 although the law allows the party to hold the convention by April 2022.Also, Section 16 of the Political Parties Act-2017 states that political parties should conduct the elections of their federal and provincial committees every five years. And if a party is unable to conduct the elections within five years due to special circumstances then it should duly inform the Election Commission and conduct the elections within the next six months.Also, Section 54 of the Political Parties Act-2017 states that any party failing to conduct the elections on time can be subjected to punishments including a fine of up to Rs 50,000 and ban on contesting elections.The aforementioned constitutional and legal provisions show political parties are legally bound to conduct their general conventions on time. Therefore, Nepali Congress joint general secretary Mahat’s claim that parties have just a moral obligation to conduct their general conventions on time is false.",1

Inclusion of these areas, which are also claimed by India, has added a pointed spur on the northwestern corner of the Nepal map. Nepal adopted the map in June 2020 with the passage of a related bill by parliament.“As far as I remember, the postage stamp issued in 2015 BS [1958-59 AD] had a pointy map [of Nepal]. But Nepal map published in the postage stamp issued after 2017 BS [1960] doesn’t have that pointy part. He [Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli] brought that pointy part back.”Saurabh, whose real name is Dinesh Satyal, made the claim while reviewing the three and a half years term of the immediate past government led by KP Sharma Oli.",1

887,PM’s suggestion of salt water gargle as home remedy ,South Asia Check,"Addressing the 5th Indradaha Tourism Festival at Dahachowk in the Kathmandu Valley on February 21, 2021, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli repeated an already debunked claim about a home remedy for Covid-19. Oli repeated the claim, which is among several claims that were flagged as false by the World Health Organization’s ‘Myth Busters’ series in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. About a year ago, many international fact-checkers had investigated and debunked a common claim that gargling with saline water or rinsing nose with the solution could prevent one from Covid-19 infection. While repeating the claim on February 21, the prime minister said some people had earlier made fun of him when he had suggested salt water gargle as a remedy.Oli said: “…Covid keeps coming and going. It gets inside the nose and then you just clean it and it will vamoose. Even if it somehow manages to get inside your throat, just gargle with warm salt water, and it will be gone.”",1
888,PM made four claims in two recent speeches,South Asia Check,"Having dissolved the House of Representatives and announcing general elections, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has recently addressed several rallies across the country. In his speeches, Oli defended his government’s move and highlighted its various achievements of the last three years of his tenure, and his previous stint as prime minister. On February 5, 2021, addressing a rally at Durbar Marg in Kathmandu, he said: “Some people have spread various misleading information about me.” But a fact-check of his recent speeches by South Asia Check found that the prime minister himself has been repeating some claims that have already been debunked by fact-checkers.First claim“During the inauguration of the substation (in Dhalkebar) today, I said 111 years ago, in 1911, hydropower was generated in Nepal from the Chandra Jyoti [named after then Rana prime minister Chandra Shumsher] Hydropower Station. Until six years ago, Nepal would not generate even 300 megawatts (MW) in total. Although Nepal was the first South Asian country to generate hydropower, it generated around 3 MW of electricity per year in the 105 years after the first hydropower project. When I became prime minister, the country was seeing 18 hours of power outage daily. But within a week of my prime ministership while addressing a Dashain festival function I announced that the next year’s Tihar festival [festival of lights] will not be celebrated in darkness. So, in order to meet the goal, my government bought electricity from India and [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi Ji and I inaugurated the construction of Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line. ” [Go to 5 mins 15 seconds into the video]Oli made the remarks at a meeting of the Progressive Engineering Association Nepal in Kathmandu on February 1, 2021. Before addressing the February 1 gathering, Oli had inaugurated the Dhalkebar substation, the country’s largest. Although some of Oli’s claims in this statement were true, two claims are false.The 500-kilowatt hydropower station in Pharping on the outskirts of Kathmandu, inaugurated by King Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah when Chandra Shumsher Janga Bahadur Rana was prime minister, is Nepal’s first hydropower project but it was not the first in South Asia.According to the Indian newspaper Times of India, India started operation of a 130-kilowatt hydroelectric project in Darjeeling in 1897. Similarly, India’s first major power station – a 4.5 MW hydropower project on the Cauvery River in Karnataka – was commissioned in 1902. Therefore, it’s wrong to say Nepal’s Chandra Jyoti Hydropower Plant was the first hydroelectricity project in South Asia.
Oli’s another claim is also wrong. He claimed that Nepal generated less than 300 MW of hydroelectricity before his first stint as prime minister in 2015. According to Nepal Electricity Authority’s annual report for 2015/16, Nepal’s installed hydropower capacity at the time was 469.29 MW. Therefore, Oli’s claim that Nepal’s generated less than 300 MW when he first became the prime minister is wrong.Second claim“A so-called Nepal banda (nationwide shutdown) was called yesterday [February 4] in an attempt to prevent you from attending this rally. What did they do to enforce their shutdown? They claim that they work for the poor, but instead of helping the working class, they spilled the vegetables of an elderly roadside woman vendor on the street in their attempt to start a revolution.” [Go to 2 mins 25 seconds into the video]Prime Minister Oli made the remarks while addressing a rally at Durbar Marg in Kathmandu on February 5. Oli was referring to some photos, which had gone viral on the social media and purportedly showed the enforcers of the February 4 shutdown, which was called by the Prachanda-Madhav faction of the Nepal Communist Party, spilling vegetables on the street. An investigation by Nepal Factcheck, a Nepali factchecking website, into the viral photos found that the photos were from a farmers’ protest in the Indian state of Maharashtra and a protest by vegetable farmers in Nepal three years ago. Prime Minister Oli has spread misinformation such as this by repeatedly making claims that have already been debunked by factcheckers.Third claim“The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution. In other words, nowhere it is written that a British prime minister can dissolve parliament. Such thing is not written in any form. But the [British] prime minister recently dissolved parliament and held elections.”Prime Minister Oli made the claim at the February 5 rally at Durbar Marg to defend his dissolution of parliament. It’s true that the UK does not have a written constitution. But it is incorrect to claim that there is no law [in the UK] that allows the prime minister to dissolve parliament. The UK’s Fixed Term Parliaments Act gives the prime minister the power to dissolve parliament under certain conditions.In the UK, there is a separate and written law on the dissolution of parliament. Laws such as the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, and the Parliament Act address major constitutional issues, according to the BBC.According to an explainer published in The Conversation, the tradition in which the prime minister requested the monarch to dissolve the parliament ended in the UK after the country enacted the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in 2011. The idea behind the Act was to curtail the power of the prime minister to dissolve parliament before completing the five-year term. Nevertheless, the Act has made two exceptions:If a motion for an early election is agreed by at least 434 MPs out of 650 (a two-thirds majority), orif a motion of no confidence is passed and no alternative government is formed within 14 days.The latest dissolution of the UK’s Parliament occurred in 2019 and elections were held in December that year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson dissolved the House of Commons in 2019. He had cited the first of the above exceptions to dissolve the House.Fourth claim“In Nepal, the Covid-19 mortality rate is low. The treatment is good. What was the situation like [in the early days of the pandemic]? There’s was no treatment. Today, 82 laboratories simultaneously conduct swab tests for Covid-19 infections every day. Today, people are being vaccinated at more than 300 booths. ” [Go to 26 mins 19 seconds into the video]This remark by the prime minister came as part of his claim that the death toll from Covid-19 has decreased as a result of the measures taken by his government. Although his claim that Covid-19 tests are conducted daily in 82 laboratories is true, the prime minister exaggerated the actual number of vaccination booths. According to the Ministry of Health, on February 1, people were vaccinated from 191 booths in 77 districts. The number of vaccine booths recently reached 201. So, the prime minister’s claim about the booth numbers is a gross overstatement.",1

There was a girl who said she was not included in the [karate] team unfairly and that she would go to South Korea on her own to participate in the games. ‘I can win gold medal but they selected others while excluded me, so I will personally fund the trip,’ she said and she went [to South Korea] and won a gold.”",1

892,Purported government text message about snap curfew,South Asia Check,"In the wee hours of October 19, the cell phones of many people in Nepal beeped with WhatsApp and SMS text messages about a curfew notice. The text message titled ‘Nepal Government Security Portal Notice’ and purportedly sent by “PSC” using bulk SMS service* caused confusion among the receivers. Many users took screenshots of the notice and shared it on Facebook and Twitter. The screenshots shared on social media show that the notice had started circulating from around 1 am on October 19. The message’s purported sender was the PSC, which is commonly understood as the acronym of the Public Service Commission, the human resource agency of the government. However, no such notice was found on the commission’s website.The text message in broken English read:  “There has been sudden issue of emergency curfew. No Netizens are allowed to step out of the house starting immediately until further notice. The Armed Police Force is constantly monitoring air traffic and working towards the neutralization of incoming threats on India-Nepal Borders. Government requests the citizens to be updated with official sources. All services except for Hospitals are shut down until further notice.”Ramesh Thapa, a resident of Manmaiju in Kathmandu, told South Asia Check that he initially got nervous after reading the message on his mobile phone on Monday morning. “At first I thought they might have imposed a curfew amid growing cases of COVID-19. But after pondering over the message, I concluded that the Public Service Commission would not issue a message related to national security. Also the language of the message was a bit unusual so I thought it must be a hoax,” Thapa said.Some social media users have speculated that the government’s bulk SMS system could have been hacked, while others tagged Nepal Police and telecommunications service providers on Twitter, calling for an investigation into the matter.",1

898, on the recent political developments in Nepal after Nepal’s parliament unanimously endorsed a bill to amend the national emblem.,south Asia Check,"In a current affairs show, DNA (Daily News and Analysis), broadcast on July 7 on Indian TV channel Zee News, Sudhir Chaudhary, the show host and the channel’s editor-in chief ,commented on the recent political developments in Nepal after Nepal’s parliament unanimously endorsed a bill to amend the national emblem. This followed the release of arevised political and administrative map by Nepal by including territories in Nepal’s northwestern region, which are currently under Indian occupation. In the context of the actions taken against Janata Samajwadi Party’s member of parliament Sarita Giri, who protested against the new map, Chaudhary said:“A few days ago, Nepal issued a new map claiming three territories of India as its own. And, the map has been endorsed by both the houses of the federal parliament of Nepal. But adecision has been taken to expel the only MP [member of parliament] who opposed the new map from her party and parliament. Sarita Giri is the MP’s name. Sarita Giri is an MP fromthe Samajwadi Party of Nepal. Sarita Giri’s fault was that she protested against the new map. And, she argued there is no basis for including Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura, and Kalapani of India in the map of Nepal. But the government of Nepal couldn’t accept this fact, for which Sarita Giri had to lose her position as a punishment for speaking the truth.”The constitution amendment bill to revise the national emblem of Nepal to include Limpiyadhura, Kalapani, and Lipulekh in the map was passed by both houses of the federal parliament and ratified by the president on June 18. As it was a matter of national sovereignty, the government, the main opposition, and all parties voted in favor of the revised map. But Janata Samajwadi Party MP Sarita Giri had openly protested against the issue. She opposed the new map stating that Nepal, before issuing the revised map, had not communicated with its two neighbors India and China. Also, speaking last month on the “Janata Janna Chanchhan” program on Prime Times TV, she had said that would not accept that Limpiyadhura belongs to Nepal.After the government brought a bill to amend the constitution to change the map of Nepal on the national emblem, Giri had registered an amendment to the government bill. But Speaker Agni Sapkota rejected Giri’s amendment proposal. And the Janata Samajwadi Party took the action against Giri after she refused to withdraw her amendment proposal ignoring the party’s instructions. Stating that Giri had violated the party’s directives and whip, the party formed a three-member inquiry committee on June 22. Mohammad Istiyak Rai, secretary of the Janata Samajwadi Party, said the committee had sought clarification from Giri and submitted a report to the party.

The interview program centered around whether the parliament would unanimously endorse the bill. Mahato said all parties support the new map but he wants a package deal on constitution amendment so as to address the grievances of the Madhesi people.In the course of the interview, Mahato made a few claims.First claim:“During the 1989 economic blockade, [the government] brought kerosene from Bangkok by air.”Toward the end of the Panchayat regime, India had imposed a 15-month-long blockade on Nepal apparently expressing dissatisfaction over Nepal’s purchase of weaponry from China. India announced the blockade right after the expiry of the Nepal-India treaties on trade and transit on March 23, 1989. India shut down 21 border points (10 main points and 11 others) with Nepal. India ended the blockade on July 1, 1990 after the restoration of democracy in Nepal.In an interview published in Nagarik daily on October 5, 2015, Nara Bahadur Budhathoki, who was Nepal’s minister for commerce and supplies during the 1989 blockade, said that India, under pressure from the international community, had allowed Nepal to import fuel from Singapore via Kolkata. A translated version of the Nagarik interview was published in the Nepali Times weekly. In the interview, Budhathoki said Nepal had imported fuel also from Bangladesh during the 1989 blockade. Similarly, a report published by the Nepal Rastra Bank after the 2015 Indian economic blockade also mentioned that Nepal had imported fuel from Singapore and Bangladesh during the 1989 economic blockade.Second claim:“Nature has been benevolent to Nepal. Nepal is world’s second richest country in terms of water resources. But the water has been flowing out of the country for nothing. I mean water dollar, white gold. But Nepalis are growing poorer and poorer.”Mahato’s second claim is also wrong. That Nepal is second richest country in the world in terms of water resources is just a popular myth.",1

910,Eligible people deprived of Nepali citizenship',By Himalayan News Service,"The House of Representatives today held a debate on the Nepal Citizenship (First Amendment) Bill. Lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties said that eligible citizens had been deprived of citizenship for long due to non-enactment of new federal citizenship law.Nepali Congress lawmaker Minendra Rijal said that the prolonged debate on citizenship had deprived eligible citizens of their nationality rights. He said Bijay Sah of Sunsari, Arjun Sah of Mahottari and Preeti Kaur of Kathmandu had not been able to obtain their Nepali citizenship and the tendency to deny citizenship to those people that look different should end. ""The narrative that one section of Nepalis has privileges started during Panchayat system and we need to stop this narrative."" He said State Affairs and Good Governance Committee inserted some provisions in the citizenship bill that were against the constitution.The House panel had proposed that foreign women marrying Nepalis could get matrimonial citizenship seven years after their matrimonial ties. Lawmakers from Nepali Congress and Madhes-based parties opposed this provision, but lawmakers from the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party (NCP) (now CPN-MC and CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) had supported the provision and passed this provision on the basis of majority.CPN-UML Lawmaker Krishna Bhakta Pokharel said that there was no need to withdraw the citizenship bill as it had settled all issues except the issue of matrimonial naturalisation on the basis of consensus. Why can' we debate about citizenship rules for foreign women marrying Nepali citizens? he wondered.Pokharel said that the House panel that debated the old bill had ensured sexual and gender minorities could get their citizenship by clearly mentioning their sexual and gender identity.Democratic Socialist Party-Nepal lawmaker Laxman Lal Karna said that it would be inhuman to prolong the debate on citizenship bill as six lakh people had been rendered stateless. ""We should not aggravate the miseries of eligible citizens who have been deprived of their citizenship.If we prolong the debate, it will be a inhuman act."" He said the House panel did not settle the issues even in three years and if the new bill was again sent to the House panel, it could again take years to settle the issues. Karna said that Nepali women marrying Nepali men were getting matrimonial naturalisation only after completing the process.He said people talk about foreign women marrying Nepali men but the government does not have record of Nepali women marrying foreign men.CPN-MC lawmaker Yashoda Gurung said the government brought a new citizenship bill without incorporating some provisions of the old bill where the House panel had inserted progressive provisions on the basis of consensus. She said the seven-year waiting period provision for foreign women marrying Nepali citizens was a good provision.CPN-UML lawmaker Nawaraj Silwal deplored that 1.2 million eligible citizens were deprived of Nepali citizenship in the absence of a new federal citizenship law. He, however, said that the seven-year waiting period for foreign women married to Nepali men was not bad as the provision aimed at giving all rights to such women except voting rights.He said the new bill did not ensure rights for sexual and gender minorities.Democratic Socialist Party-Nepal lawmaker Anil Kumar Jha wondered who would take responsibility for depriving eligible citizens for the last seven years. He also said that the KP Sharma Oli government had brought the citizenship ordinance with almost the same provisions that the current bill had, but his party lawmakers did not oppose the ordinance then and they were opposing the bill now.Rastriya Janamorcha lawmaker Durga Paudel said that Nepal was situated between giant neighbours and therefore, citizenship law should have stricter provisions so that any foreigner could not obtain Nepali citizenship.",0

On Saturday alone, Rs 25.56 billion of the allotted funds were used from the government's treasury, according to the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO).Likewise, remittance inflows, which had slowed down since the beginning of the current fiscal year, has seen a slight uptick in the recent times.

937,Sah to challenge JC's decision to remove her from High Court,By HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Renuka Sah, who was removed as High Court judge by the Judicial Council for 'concealing her ineligibility' for high court judgeship, said the JC's decision was prejudiced and she would challenge her removal in a court of law.Sah said if she did not challenge the JC's decision to remove her as a high court judge, it would mean that she had accepted the JC's charge of ineligibility. ""Judgeship is an honour and the JC gave me this honour. I had not filed an application for the job,"" Sah said.She said Sallu Tiwari had challenged the appointment of eight high court judges, including her appointment. In that case, the Supreme Court had quashed the writ petition on 2 June 2019 observing that it would be prima facie wrong to conclude that an authentic body as the JC would err in nominating judges. ""If the SC verdict was wrong, a review petition had to be filed, but that judgment was final,"" Sah argued.Sah said Acting Chief Justice Deepak Kumar Karki, who is also the chair of the Judicial Council, decided to remove her as a high court judge, but when she was nominated by the JC in 2019 for high court judge, Karki had also consented as he was a member of the JC on account of being the senior-most justice of the Supreme Court. ""Had Justice Karki any doubt about my eligibility, he should have written a note of dissent back then,"" Sah said and added that although she did not plead in the court, she had provided pro bono service to her clients from 2006.Sah said she had received permission from Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training CTEVT to practise law during off-duty hours and at her leisure time. The CTEVT had decided on 28 July 2003 to allow her to practise law. She and her lawyer partners have a law firm Kathmandu Lawyers Pvt Ltd, which was registered in their name on 14 February 2012.""Sometimes I took leave from CTEVT to provide legal counselling and other services to my clients,"" she added. Sah said Article 140 (2) of the constitution that lists criteria for high court judgeship had not stated that court practice, particularly pleading, was the sole criteria for appointment.""When I practised law, lawyers were not mandated to register their firms,"" she said and added that she had, however, registered her law firm at the Company Registrar Office 10 years ago. Sah had worked as an associate with Senior Advocate Sher Bahadur KC and Ramji Bista in the past.""Eligibility for high court judgeship does not require maintenance of court appearance record. Providing legal opinion as a pro bono lawyer is also the job of a lawyer. Chamber practice is lawyering,"" Sah said.She said she had worked as a high court judge for the last four years and nobody raised questions on her performance.Sah said negative comments were made against her since her appointment in the high court by those people who might have grudges against her father Ram Kumar Prasad Sah.My father is a man of integrity and everybody knows it. If he wanted to appoint me as a judge, he could have done it when he was a senior justice of the SC or the CJ,"" Renuka Sah said.

942,No policy allows businesses to run on footpath',By Rastriya Samachar Samiti,"Kathmandu Metropolitan City has clarified that it does not have the policy of allowing the operation of any sort of business on the footpath.The KMC policy states that no goods and commodities, including foodstuff, can be sold and distributed from the roadside or on the footpath at any time. Talking to the RSS, KMC Police Chief Dhanapati Sapkota said footpath management was one of the prime responsibilities given by the KMC to the Metropolitan Police.""The pavement is for pedestrians. It is not made for running shops and stalls. Those operating shops and stalls without obeying this rule have been hauled and their goods confiscated,"" KMC Police Chief said, reminding that newly-elected Mayor Balendra Shah had announced that businesses run on the footpath during the time of filing his candidacy would be managed.Shah was elected KMC mayor through the municipal election held a couple of months ago. It is also stated in the Policy and Programmes for the next fiscal year passed by the KMC municipal assembly on June 22 that businesses operating on the footpath would be controlled.""We have moved forward the work as per the decision of the KMC Executive. There's no reason to protest regarding the matter. What's the point in protesting when we have carried out our job in line with the Municipal Executive's decision? It is also our responsibility to transform the business operated on the footpath so that they come under the ambit of tax,"" Sapkota elaborated.Stating that it was natural to deal with criticisms while carrying out works, he said the KMC had only been controlling encroachment on the roads and pavements. ""Business operated on the pavement or roads will be affected when the authorities try to control encroachment,"" he said. The KMC Police Chief said he had taken such comments and criticisms as obvious.He insisted that the work on footpath management had been expedited as per the interest of the general public. Sapkota said, ""Running a business using the street is not positive in any sense. The policy of the KMC mentions that no one is allowed to run business in the street round-theclock and if it has been taking place somewhere, it is being operated clandestinely. KMC will take initiative to bring all of them under the ambit of law in the coming days.""""The city police has been focusing on bringing the vendors under control in the morning and evening when the movement of people is high,"" he opined. The KMC faced mounting criticism after a video of the city police confiscating good from a couple selling maize on the street and misbehaving with the couple was uploaded on social media.The KMC has been working to control street encroachment by deploying four teams on a daily basis. Mostly, the streets of Sundhara, New Road, Baneshwor, Koteshwor, Gaushala, Chabahil, New Bus Park, Balaju, Kalanki and Kalimati are being encroached.""The KMC was compelled to take such action after its frequent requests not to run any business encroaching the street were ignored,"" Sapkota argued. According to the KMC, goods confiscated from the vendors are put up for auction.Similarly, goods that become stale easily as well as fruits, vegetables and flammable substances are returned to the concerned businessman after taking fine from them.In the current fiscal year, the local government has proceeded with the sale of confiscated goods at an auction and in the previous fiscal year, goods including iron items, hoarding boards, bicycles and carts worth Rs 5.2 million were sold at an auction, he said.",0
943,CPN-MC forms 156-member politburo,By Rastriya Samachar Samiti,"The CPN-Maoist Centre today formed a 156-member politburo and 41-member standing committee.The central committee meeting of the party formed the politburo and standing committee, but failed to name office bearers as party Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal sought more time to prepare the list of standing committee members. Dahal proposed the names of politburo and standing committee members. All top leaders -- Dahal, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, Dev Prasad Gurung, Janardan Sharma, Barshaman Pun, and Haribol Gajurel -- are members of the politburo and the standing committee.Initially, Dahal had proposed 125-member politburo, but as some CC members raised objections, saying the party chair nominated politburo members without following any criteria, Dahal added 31 alternative members to the politburo.Narayan Kaji Shrestha said there was confusion about the names of politburo members as Dahal mistakenly read out the names from a raw draft. Shrestha said the CC meeting had finalised 15 members of the standing committee and would name the remaining 26 members soon.CPN-MC leader Giriraj Mani Pokharel said Dahal added names after some leaders pointed out that senior leaders and leaders from provinces were not included in the politburo.Asked if Dahal used his own discretion to name members in the politburo and the standing committee, Pokharel said Dahal had the party leaders' faith and had named members of party bodies in accordance with the party's eighth general convention. ""We had elected party leaders in the general convention on the basis of consensus. This time too we have selected members of top bodies of the party on the basis of consensus,"" he said.He said the party would soon name office bearers as well.Dahal announced in the CC meeting today that Narayan Kaji Shrestha would be the senior vice-chair of the party.A version of this article appears in the print on July 8, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.

946,Stumbling vaccination programme needs fixing,By Prof Kiteshwari Pootkotakis,"Dealing with COVID-19 requires decisive and evidence-based leadership committed to working in the public interest. Unfortunately, Nepal is yet to demonstrate this, as is evident from the lazy, opaque, and visionless vaccination programme.The COVID-19 vaccination drive can still be fixed with common sense and time-tested lessons from Nepal's home-grown immunisation experience. One, scale-up vaccination sites. If Nepal has tens of thousands of vaccination sites when routinely immunising children, there is no reason not to have an even higher number for COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, the COVID-19 virus does not stop transmiting from 9:00am to 5:00pm and does not take Saturdays off.Therefore, neither should the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nepal.Two, widen reach by engaging the 70 per cent of the health care system of Nepal, which is private. If this can be done for testing and hospital beds, then there is no reason not to find a solution to this. Moreover, the hesitance of the technocrats in engaging the private health providers is puzzling as many of these technocrats have well nurtured private sector investments, interests, and practice.Three, don't set up standards higher than those of high-income countries. This entails relaxing the criteria for who can administer vaccines. For example, instead of restricting the giving of vaccines only to trained health care professionals, allow medical students and trained volunteers to administer COVID-19 vaccines.Four, lay out in public all your thinking about vaccines and vaccination. Information on vaccine stocks by brand and their expiry date must be released to the public. It is critical to share what else is in the pipeline with the public.Five, release the vaccination calendar by district, criteria, date, time, and venue for the next one month. This will allow for proper micro-planning at the ward level. This schedule should be made available through TV, radio, leaflets, and social media.No immunisation campaign has succeeded without microplanning.Six, Communicate, Communicate and Communicate. Silence, mixed messaging, and piece-meal information erode trust.The radio waves need to be jammed with encouraging messaging; miking in the narrowest lanes with catchy jingles should be conducted. Teachers, priests, and parents in the community need to be invited to help mobilise people. To achieve scale, vaccination information needs to be demonopolised from the custodians of social media platforms, websites, and mobile apps and be made available proactively through mediums that the ordinary people of Nepal use.Pro-poor thinking needs to be the hallmark of vaccine communication in Nepal.Seven, be honest and fair to health workers of Nepal. While health technocrats gracing their offices in Kathmandu have regularly received risk allowances, they have deprived the frontline health workers of the same.The big elephant in Nepal's COVID-19 response room is pending risk allowance payments. They need to be settled immediately, or health workers will find a way of not cooperating and understandably so.Eight, fix the information management chaos which you have created. If Pathao, Foodmandu, and FedEx can flawlessly track their supply chain in real-time in Nepal, why can't the government? The digitisation of vaccination and the QR bungling indicates incompetence, neglect, and possible corruption.Nine, appeal to the Supreme Court to scrap all Non-Disclosure Agreements on the price of vaccine procurement in the public interest. Now that vaccine availability and efficacy data are all in the public domain, there is no justification to disclose how public money is being spent.The call by the PM for procurement of more vaccines needs to be matched with transparency on spending.Ten, technocrats need to generate a sense of urgency in their heads and hearts. They should consider that karma may be a better determinant of the health of the people they are entrusted to care for only after all scientific evidence-based decisions have failed.Summa summarum, the way things are headed and in the absence of urgent course correction, Nepal's COVID-19 vaccination will not achieve its target of providing a safety blanket to its population for lack of quick coverage of the maximum people.More will continue to succumb to this nasty disease. While we mourn the fallen, we should also mourn the psyche to fail by choice in the presence of resources and expertise in the land of Buddha's birth.(Prof Kiteshwari Pootkotakis is a medical anthropologist of Greek-Nepali heritage. She writes on contemporary global health issues and on feminism. She calls Thessaloniki, Copenhagen, and Toronto her homes.She has often visited Nepal the past 30 years and collaborates closely with Nepali academia on health and anthropology. She also advises international health organisations and governments on how to sustainably improve access to health).

In comparison, helmets are going to be made mandatory because two-wheeler vehicles have more accidents and the passengers sitting in the back die due to 'head injury'.

984,"Ensure security personnel, staff on poll day get to vote: SC",By Ram Kumar Kamat,"The Supreme Court has ordered the government to ensure that security personnel, including Nepali Army soldiers in military barracks, government employees deployed on poll duty, prisoners, and detainees have the right to vote in the upcoming parliamentary elections likely to be held in November.A single bench of Justice Bishwambhar Shrestha passed the interim order in response to a writ petition filed by Nishant Pokharel and others against the government. The apex court ordered the government to enrol security personnel and government employees deployed for election duty, prisoners, and detainees in the temporary voter list so that they could vote under the proportional representation election system. The bench also issued a show cause notice to the government telling it to submit a written reply within 15 days.The apex court stated that the government should ensure that names of security personnel, government employees deployed for poll duty, prisoners, and detainees are listed in the temporary voter list as Section 30 (1) of Voter Roll Act stipulates that the EC could prepare a separate temporary voter roll for security personnel and government employees for elections under proportionate representation system.Section 30 (2) lists the categories of people who could be enrolled in temporary voter list, including prisoners and detainees.The court observed that it would be rational to ensure voting rights of government employees and security personnel on poll duty since the constitution ensured freedom of expression and voting rights of all citizens above the age of 18.The SC stated that in the Election Commission's book, Nepalko Nirbachan Itihas, it was mentioned that names of government employees and security personnel on poll duty, NA members deployed in barracks, and prisoners were in the temporary voters' list and they had exercised their voting rights.The SC ordered the government to make necessary arrangements for the preparation of temporary voter list so as to ensure voting rights of the people listed in Section 30 (1) and 30 (2) of the Voter Roll Act in accordance with the spirit of the Act.Petitioners have named the Prime Minister's Office, the Council of Ministers, the Home Ministry, and the EC as defendants.The EC has been updating voters' list for the upcoming federal and provincial polls since June 15.The SC issued the order on July 14 but released its full text today.",0

986,EDITORIAL: Secure health services,By The Himalayan Times,"President Bidhya Devi Bhandari authenticated the Security of Health Workers and Health Organisations (First Amendment) Act on July 15, awarding stringent punishment to anyone who commits offence against health personnel or health organisations.The law, which was first introduced in 2010, had to be amended to provide legal protection to the health personnel and health organizations due to the growing incidents of offences against them over the death of a patient in the course of medical treatment.It has become common for relatives of the deceased patient(s) to resort to violence against the health personnel and vandalise the health facility even without knowing the actual cause of the death. They also demand hefty sums of money in compensation from the health institutions over the death of a patient. As per the new provision, which came into force immediately, if any person commits an offence in contravention of the law in a way to harm the health personnel or a health institution, s/he will be liable to imprisonment for a term ranging from two years to five years or a fine not exceeding Rs 500,000 or both. This legal provision ensures the safety and security of all those working in the health sector, be it a public or private health institution.It has also stated that compensation will be recovered from the offender(s) depending on the degree of harm caused to the health personnel and health institution. The law also prohibits picketing, manhandling or misbehaving with any health worker on the issue of medical treatment, obstructing delivery of health services, padlocking, destroying, torching and vandalising any health institution. The health workers or health institution concerned may request the local administration for security should a person or group resort to such acts in any health institution. It will be the duty of the local administration to provide security to the health workers and health institution upon request. An 11-member health worker and health institution security coordination committee, headed by a 12th level official of the Ministry of Health and Population, shall be formed to provide security to the health workers and health institution.While it is commendable that the law has provided safety and security to the health workers and health institutions, it should also have enough room for punishment for the erring health personnel and health institution as well as a package of compensation for the affected patient(s) or their kin. It is not true that the patient(s) or their relatives are always on the wrong side of the law. There have been reports that proved health personnel and health institutions had erred while providing health services to the people. In such cases, the court of law should decide the case through a fast-track process so that the affected person(s) could get compensation as determined by the concerned body. As affected patient(s) and their relatives are not organised, the law should also give them enough room for laying claims on the harm that the health workers and health institutions inflict on the patients. Providing medical treatment or conducting a surgery based on wrong diagnosis is the most common problem the general people face in many of the private health institutions which lack the desired expertise.Waste segregationManaging Kathmandu's waste has taken up the greater part of the new mayor's attention since taking office towards the end of May. It's only been some time that heaps of garbage that had collected at every street corner of the Kathmandu Valley have begun to be picked up regularly. Even now, garbage continues to be strewn along the river banks or in the open fields along the roads because the municipalities are unable to take care of all the waste generated in the valley.In a bid to manage the ever-growing waste, Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has announced an initiative to segregate waste at the source. Beginning July 17, the KMC, under the campaign, will collect only biodegradable waste on Sundays and Wednesdays and non-biodegradable waste on Mondays and Fridays. Chandragiri Municipality has pledged to support KMC's efforts, and all other municipalities of the valley are expected to do so likewise. The initiative should reduce the amount of waste being transported to the landfill site at Bancharedanda while increasing its lifespan. Furthermore, money generated from the sale of compost fertiliser should add, whatever little, to the municipalities' resources.

987,Waste in cities: Problem and awareness,By The Himalayan Times,"As per various published sources, the Kathmandu Valley produces 1,200 metric tons of solid waste daily, out of which only 50 percent is disposed of by Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). The actual data could be even more as the city gets more polluted and unmanaged with each passing year. With growing urbanisation, improved living standards and changing consumption patterns, the city has had to deal with more and more piles of waste every day only to see its living standard and quality of life deteriorate.The Solid Waste Management Act, 2068 has made the local governments responsible for the operation and management of infrastructure for the collection, treatment and final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). But, the local government of Kathmandu has failed to manage the huge amounts of solid waste lying across the KMC, and though efforts are being made, it is yet to reach a definitive state.Currently, there are no formal municipal waste recovery and recycling programmes in many municipalities of Nepal, including the KMC. Most of the waste is being collected by the local communities and the private sector that are responsible for the collection and dumping of solid waste. The private sector collects 79 per cent of the total solid waste of the Kathmandu Valley, which used to be dumped at the Sisdol landfill site until recently. But just collection and dumping of solid waste at a landfill site cannot be considered proper waste management.Additionally, there are not many initiatives that are worthy of note with regards to the segregation of solid waste at least into organic and inorganic. There is also that necessity to establish upcycling, recycling, resource recovery and treatment facilities beyond just segregation.The concept of waste as a potential income source has been introduced and practised these days by private organisations that rely on collected plastics, glass, metals and paper. These establishments could be a motivation for waste upcycling, recycling and recovery in a proper way.There is an effective way to minimise waste. It's through behavioural changes through the practice of reducing, reusing and recycling, which must be initiated from each household. Every piece of waste that is produced can somewhat be reduced, reused or recycled. But this is not being done. It is not known how much waste from each household is being produced every day or by what route it is being transferred. This data would play a critical role in the real management of waste which includes management at the source and at the landfill site.Likewise, there is a mindset that waste is a non-usable, unnecessary and deteriorating commodity hampering both people's health and the environment. If waste management infrastructure/facility is put in place, people will be more aware of the waste they produce, and will be managed at their doorstep.A formal municipal waste collection and management programme is also highly required. Inconsistent waste picking is evident here, which requires proper management with the local government's involvement and interference. In the case of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, representatives of each ward should be seriously involved in waste management, giving it high priority.It is understood that the collected solid waste from all over the Kathmandu Valley is supposed to be taken to the government-run Teku Transfer Station first, but segregation of the waste is not done there. Only some private organizations are involved in segregating their waste, that too haphazardly near river banks or under bridges. This is of utmost concern, and an option must be found.After the work at the transfer station is nonchalantly completed, the waste is directly dumped at Sisdol and now at Bancharedanda. Sisdol, which is overworked, has a height of 100 metres and a width of 300 to 350 metres. The accumulated waste has been harmful to the general population and the environment around the site. Especially leachate, methane gas and other greenhouse gases keep oozing out of the dump, which should be taken into account to save the lives of the people living around the Sisdol site.With the Bancharedanda site being brought into operation, the solution lies in preventing organic and recyclable waste from being dumped at the landfill sites, which will increase the life of the landfill site. The infrastructure for segregation along with training and technology at the source and at various dumping stations is required. Segregation at the source is more effective as it is more hygienic and economic than picking recyclable materials at the landfill/dumping sites.Wards of the city should monitor the waste training programme, and once the infrastructure is built, regulations to control violations should be established. Organic waste can be composted at the household level if a small land/yard is available, or else each ward can collect organic waste and use it as a co-substrate with sewage, sludge, cattle manure, poultry litter for biogas generation, while inorganic waste such as plastic, paper, metal, textile pieces can be recycled. The need for fertiliser can also be met by the use of composted organic solid waste.Lastly, treating waste as an income-generating commodity can be well advertised to make people realise waste is not a source of contamination but rather a raw material for a wellversed entrepreneurial venture. The products developed from the recycling of waste require use to overturn the preconceived notion that it is not reliable. And the raw materials generated from waste can be a source of national income and must be given a chance by the manufacturers and distributors.Lohani and Nepal are with the Renewable and Sustainable Laboratory (RSEL) at Kathmandu University.

988,UBUNTU' architecture: Approach to creating human dignity,By DEVENDRA NATH GONGAL,"Before the end of this year, the greatest show on earth, ""FIFA World Cup 2022"", will start in Qatar.Impressive architecture of stadiums, hotels and other facilities will enhance Qatar's ambition, evoking the history of edifices like the Egyptian Pyramids, Great Wall of China and Suez Canal as examples of engineering and architectural marvels. But erased from history are the deaths of a million labourers in each of these edifices, which, however, is romanticised to emphasise the merit of these achievements, where the working conditions equalled all abuses of human dignity. Many things have changed drastically since then, and today the world is sensitive towards human rights, child labour, gender equality, indigenous people's rights and the environment.""Football is a beautiful game"", and the architecture of the stadiums where it is played is equally beautiful. But what is happening in the construction industry in WC Qatar, and the Middle East, is not beautiful.Former General Secretary of Amnesty International Salid Shetty called it a ""stain in the consciousness of world football"". It has triggered an ethical debate on whether the end justifies the process. For this obvious reason, architects are naturally expected to be reasonably sensitive towards the modus operandi of the production of architecture.CNN said, ""Each stadium design represents Qatar's history and culture"". Some footballers, however, expressed in exasperation that ""that thousands must die to build stadiums has nothing to do with football"".Out of the 6,750 labourers who died before the end of 2020 since the Cup was awarded to Qatar, 1,641 were Nepalis, and the International Trade Union Confederation estimated that 7,000 will die by the time the WC tournaments kick off.At some point of time, two Nepalis died every three days. Nepali workers were not allowed to visit their home country in 2015 during the great earthquake to help their families. A group of intellectuals and activists from around the world reacted with an open letter published in The Financial Times, to allow them leave on humanitarian grounds. Amnesty International said Qatar used the COVID-19 pandemic as a ruse to expel Nepali workers. These numbers represent inhumanity and injustice, because these deaths were not accidents but were the result of ""profit before safety"", sheer negligence and working conditions of 'an absolute human disgrace'. This is the quintessential modern slavery.These deaths were not necessary for creating architectural edifices. In previous world games, there were six deaths in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, one in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, two in the 2010 South Africa WC, one in 2012 London Olympics, 10 in the 2014 Brazil WC, and 40 in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.The Guardian in 2014 exposed and enabled the world to look at the working condition of Nepali workers in this World Cup. FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura reacted with programmes to help tackle issues of green stadiums and labour rights, among others. All this is transforming football stadiums, suddenly, from football tournament venues to a stage to provoke discourse on morality and ethics in the construction industry. It has revived an ethical dilemma for architects, providing an appropriate opportunity to promote social justice and human rights.This ideological issue related to workers' plight dragged the late Queen of Curves, Zaha Hadid, the architect of Al-Janoub Stadium, into controversy. She committed herself to work for safe and fair working conditions at construction sites around the world, although initially she responded by saying, ""I have nothing to do with workers"", and ""it's not my duty as an architect to look at it"".Zaha Hadid coming into the picture of the plight of workers in World Cup Stadium, nevertheless, may have catalysed the changes brought about in the draconian Kafla system. This law was removed in 2020 after harsh criticism from around the world, 'but the condition remains exploitative as its implementation is weak'.Justice and human rights are not matters of mere politics, neither is architecture.These are just ""human"".Migrant construction workers in Qatar, including those building WC stadiums, are working in potentially life-threatening heat and humidity, according to research carried out by HR Wath. ILO labeled the workers' plight as a ""living nightmare"", human right activists called it ""modern-day slavery"". Barun Ghimire, a Nepali human rights lawyer, has said that ""The World Cup is really the Bloody Cup – the blood of the migrant workers"".Norwegian Supporters' Alliances aptly said that playing in Qatar will be like playing on a cemetery. The Guardian reported that a professional Liverpool club demanded thorough investigation into these deaths, before they go to play in this World Cup.The issues for the architects are not only what is happening in the Middle East, but the whole construction industry. Architect James Russel said that ""architects do have a moral imperative to collectively work with labour-right groups and other construction-related professions to end abuse of the powerless by the powerful"".We should aim to eradicate modern slavery from the built environment and building materials supply chain, adding ""human dignity' as an imperative element in architecture and construction. Advocacy and awareness are crucial for this. Lessons can be learnt from a Nepali organisation, ""Animal Nepal"", devoted to the welfare of cruelly-treated donkeys in Nepali brick kilns. Its efforts brought upon a positive improvement on the condition of the donkeys.Architecture may be ""frozen music"" as Goethe said, but it should not be composed from the tones of agony of servitude and should not be blood stained in form and in content. Let the African term UBUNTU (I am because we are) be the philosophical approach for the creation of ""architecture with human dignity"".Gongal is past chairman, SAARC Association of Architect.",0
989,EDITORIAL: Succour to farmers,By The Himalayan Times,"In what is a major stimulus to the farmer, both the Houses of the Parliament recently endorsed the bill to amend the Seeds Act 1988, which stipulates a provision of compensation for crop failure. With its authentication by the President, the bill has taken the form of an Act. Under Section 11 of the Act, any farmer suffering crop failure or a poor harvest that is substantially less than the supposed produce despite the use of seeds, fertilisers, techniques and process recommended by any government organisation, agency, company or firm is entitled to reasonable compensation from the concerned recommending agency.With the population nearly doubling since the 1980s, farmers have been switching to imported hybrid seeds and using more fertilisers and pesticides to get a bumper harvest, but this has not always been successful, rather it has proved disastrous. At times, the recommended maize varieties, for example, did not yield even a single grain, leaving the farmers high and dry. The farmers received no compensation from the seeds importing agencies and were instead blamed for not following the required procedure.The Act thus seeks to prohibit the sale or distribution of seeds that are not listed in a notification published in the Nepal Gazette, except for the purpose of agricultural research. Similarly, the Act requires the concerned persons or organisations to conduct a risk analysis before importing or exporting any variety of seeds or genetically modified organism or living modified organism that may cause adverse impacts on humans and animals or the environment. Based on the risk analysis, the government may impose a ban on any seeds not deemed appropriate for Nepal. The Act also requires any person or organisation seeking to produce source seeds to first acquire a license from the National Seeds Board formed by the government.The problem of crop failure, however, is not only with the seeds sold openly in Nepal's countryside.The open border to the south makes it difficult to control the smuggling of sub-standard fertilisers, which are always in short supply when the farmers need them the most. Even during the paddy planting season this year, the government has not been able to import the needed urea in time.While welcoming the provisions stipulating compensation for the farmers for crop failure in the amended Seeds Act, one will know about its effectiveness only when it is put into practice. It is not that the government does not have laws at present on what agro inputs can be imported and what cannot be. But it has always faltered when it comes to implementation.There are high chances of some clever farmers having links with the farm inspectors misusing the laws to get compensation while the majority are unable to access it. Misappropriation of funds meant for agro projects has been reported in the past, with even high-level officials entangled in it.Thus, the success of the Seed Act hinges on effective monitoring and integrity of the government-appointed inspectors, apart from being able to coerce the importers to pay compensation. There is no doubt that the effective implementation of the Seeds Act would go a long way in ensuring food security in the country.Save ChureThe Chure range stretching from east to west is the youngest mountain in the Himalayan region, and it is also the major source of water for irrigation and drinking in the Tarai region. It helps maintain the ecosystem, climate and environment in the Tarai and Mahabharat range. Fragile as it is, any disruption in the Chure range will have a devastating impact in the entire Tarai belt, which is the food basket of the country.Over exploitation of the Chure range, especially for sand, boulders and timber, over the decades has not only threatened its very existence but also that of the Tarai region, which is at risk of desertification. Should the Chure range dry up due to massive landslides and flash floods, the plains of the country will turn into a desert. In order to conserve the Chure range, the President Chure Conservation Programme was launched when Dr Ram Baran Yadav served as the country's first president. But the programme, which is still ongoing, could not function as per its expectations due to political interference, lack of budget and institutional capacity. The Chure range can still be saved provided the government imposes a complete ban on extracting sand and boulders from its bed and rivers flowing from it.",0
990,The dancer who defied odds,the kathmandu post,"When Jagadish Gurung was growing up, making a career out of dance was something unheard of. But this didn’t stop the teenage Gurung, a native of Illam’s Ilang village, from deciding to become a professional dancer.Gurung, who is known by his stage name JD Tamu is one of the more popular names in Nepal’s dance choreography scene, and he has already taken part in multiple dance reality shows in Nepal (Boogie Woogie Nepal and Dancing Stars Nepal), worked as a dance choreographer for several music videos, and half a dozen theatre plays. He also conducts contemporary dance workshops for actors taking theatre classes and works as a dance instructor for several dance academies.“I am actually an average dancer. When I was studying dance, other students were much better dancers than me,” says Gurung, now 29. “I think I am here today just because of my hard work and determination. This is why I strongly believe that consistency is the key to success.”Gurung grew up in a joint family of 18 members, and as the eldest son of his parents, he had to shoulder family responsibilities from a very young age.“My parents worked as agricultural labourers. I still vividly remember how much they got paid for an entire day of work. My father got paid Rs 40, and my mother got Rs 25. And occasionally, I would also go and work with them, and I got paid Rs 8,” says Gurung.Apart from going to work with his parents, Gurung, as the eldest son, was responsible for cooking for the family and getting fodder for the family’s livestock.After completing his secondary school, Gurung’s parents sent him to live with his maternal uncle in the nearby town of Jhapa to pursue his high school.“My parents gave me Rs 1,500 to cover my expenses in Jhapa, and I saved Rs 500 from it so that I could join martial arts class,” says Gurung, who grew up watching action movies of actors like Nikhil Upreti and Biraj Bhatta.But when Gurung finally went to get admission at a centre in Birtamod that provided martial arts classes, the staff informed him that the classes would only resume after a week. Since other centres offered dance and music classes, Gurung decided to enrol in music classes to learn singing. “But at the very last moment, I became quite curious about dance and decided to opt for dance classes instead.”Gurung liked dancing, but after the two-month-long dance course got over, he didn’t have the money to enrol in another class. Gurung then started working as a part-time teacher, and once he had saved enough money, he joined another dance class. This class was led by Chandra Chamling, a Bhutanese refugee who would go on to become Gurung’s dance mentor and the person responsible for completely transforming the way Gurung perceived dance. Gurung continued taking dance classes until he finished high school.

991,"‘I have worked hard to be where I am today’
",the kathmandu post,"On June 23, ‘Look Up’, an anthology of four different stories, was released in Hong Kong. What made the film special for Hong Kong’s Nepali community was ‘Under The Lion Pole’, one of the film’s four stories. ‘Under The Lion Pole’ told the story of Chandra, a Nepali boy in Hong Kong, and his obsession with the traditional Chinese lion dance. Bipin Karma, a Hong Konger actor of Nepali origin, played the role of Chandra.While many in Nepal might not be familiar with the name Bipin Karma, the actor is known among Hong Kong’s small Nepal community as one of the very few Nepali-origin actors to make a mark in Hong Kong’s film industry, where the majority of actors are Chinese origin.Karma was only eight when he immigrated to Hong Kong from Nepal when he was eight years old. He has only been active in the film industry for a year but has already played prominent roles in two films.On a recent Zoom call with the Post’s Pinki Sris Rana, Karma talked about what it means to be a Nepali-origin actor in Hong Kong’s film industry, the challenges he continues to face in his career, and his future plans.The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.You have often said that you never dreamt of being an actor, and this was something fate had in store for you. Tell us how you ended up in the film industry?Growing up, I was an introvert and didn’t really talk much. Because of this, many even thought I was a mute. I was also very much into martial arts, and it became my medium of expression. After my grandmother’s demise, I migrated to Hong Kong. I was eight years old at the time. Since I didn’t speak Mandarin or Cantonese, I think I became more withdrawn than ever. When I was going through all this, I got involved in parkour and started making parkour videos. This was how I began exploring the field of visual media, and soon I started making short films.

992,"The power of plays to be a visceral experience

",the kathmandu post,"Before the play ‘Aiya! Maya’ is played out on stage at Kausi Theatre, Teku, some theatre artists can be seen mentally and physically preparing themselves around the almost barren stage. The five artists involved in the play—Akash Nepali, Aayan Khadka, Sarita Kathayat, Shishir Shiwakoti, Pabitra Rai, and Mukti—run, dance, do cartwheels, and simply let their bodies and mind become as free and flexible as they can be.The rehearsal and preparation of their mindset for the play sets the overall theme of the play—emotional expression through physical movements.Directed by Sudam Ck, the play is a one-of-a-kind theatre experience where raw human emotions, not events or conflict, move the plot forward.While recent plays in Nepali theatres have focused on telling a story and crafting powerful narratives, the power of theatre to juxtapose unrestrained physical actions with intense human emotions has somewhat taken back seat. In contrast, ‘Aiya! Maya’ takes us through a journey where the main goal is not to understand but to feel and experience. It’s a visceral celebration of the power of theatre as a form of performing arts.As the play gains momentum, it starts to feel like a series of diary entries brought to life on stage. There’s a scene at the beginning of the play when the artists act as if they lost an essence of themselves. They start running around frantically, searching for themselves and others, unable to talk. In another following scene, the artists emote unravelling themselves, like they are reaching into their own depths and forcing out their creativity for the world to see.Presenting these personal hardships in an abstract format helps to universalise them. The familiar paradox of the most personal being the most universal is in motion in the play. As the audience, we see the emotions and pain of feeling lost, not fitting in, and forcing ourselves to change ourselves to fit in, reflected on stage through the artists’ actions. In one scene, Aayan Khadka sits on a small chair in the middle of the stage while the other artists stand like statues, occasionally changing their postures on the corners of the stage. Khadka starts a monologue by reciting his daily night schedule and shares that he stands in front of a mirror contemplating his physicality and mentality before going to sleep.The play’s minimalist approach to costume design and set design puts the spotlight on the artists, their actions and distinct motifs. While most artists wear simple grey tops and shorts, Mukti wears an additional bright red scarf. Throughout the play, he acts as an observer and protagonist viewing the world around him. As the play moves along, he also takes out a bright red umbrella and eventually a bright red diary. The motif of red colour might symbolise the overall theme of love in the play.The stage for the play is almost barren except for a few props: there are five small white stools, and the artists bring out a long and bulky rope near the end of the play. The barrenness of the stage allows the artists to freely move around and express themselves while the minimal props are used innovatively. In one scene, while the artists and the live music artistssing the cover of the song ‘Tu Hi Re’, the stools are used as steps and placed in front one after the other allowing the artists to act as if they are crossing a river.The play’s namesake hints at the duality of love: how it can sustain us and also damage us. Narrations of diary entries, intimate conversations between lovers, and singing of love songs are used throughout the play to emphasise the power of love. Love can be a panacea to the pain and hurt in a world that often feels cruel and unforgiving.The prowess of director Sudam Ck shines throughout the play, as every moment in the play feels like visual poetry. The artists move with water-like fluidity, the use of smoke and lighting gives an ethereal ambience on the stage, and the live music artists—Sharmila Gurung and Shivaraj Joshi—perfectly convey the emotions illustrated on stage with background music and songs. The use of music and songs to dictate actions on stage is also a provocative aspect of the play. It provides structure and rhythm to the play as we switch from scene to scene.One of the most powerful scenes in the play is when Aayan Khadka assumes the role of an oppressor. The other artists wrap a long rope around his neck, as if they are putting a garland of flowers on him. Khadka soon realises the extent of his power and how he can make other people move, breathe, and live as he dictates. The acting skills of the other artists and the expression of Khadka as he wields his authoritative power is a scathing commentary on the political climate of our country. The leaders act like puppeteers while the common public is forced to be puppets, forgoing all their agency.The play’s approach to theatre as an abstract art form means that it may not be everyone’s cup of tea. We, as the audience, are accustomed to being fed the story through dialogues, conflict, and action. We rarely have to think and analyse visual stories, the end of one scene perfectly linking the start to another. However, performing arts have the potential to make the audience leave their comfort zone and to make them contemplate and reflect inwards.The play has dared to break through the comforts of a conventional approach to theatre. Without rules and structure, art can be anything. Art can be freedom, and there’s a certain beauty to art when it’s unbridled. There’s no story to be understood in the play ‘Aiya! Maya’. There’s only the opportunity for the audience to connect with the artists on stage and celebrate the emotions, good and bad, that make us human.

He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and clutched the arm of his chair with both hands.“Are you alright, constable Shankar?” a voice floated to his ears, and he almost jumped to his chair. The incidents of the past few days had left constable Chettri shaken. A few days ago, Chettri almost got shot by a criminal, and since then, he hadn’t been his usual carefree self.“I’m sorry, boss. It’s just that I..”“You don’t have to be sorry, Shankar. It’s perfectly fine.

But you don’t understand. Working on cases makes me feel alive. If I don't work, I become sweaty and jittery. I need some action, and I need it quickly.""Pandey drew a deep breath and said, “I won’t force you to take a break, Shankar. But, whenever you feel like having one, just tell me. I will grant you two weeks of paid leave.”Just then, the phone rang. Chettri immediately picked up the receiver and answered the call.“Hello, this is Nepal Police. How can we help you?”He could hear someone breathing heavily from the other end. Chettri sank to his chair and held his breath while waiting for the caller to speak.

994,"Entrapped in their beauty

",the kathmandu post,"For the last few weeks, Thamel’s art galleries have seen a flurry of art exhibitions. One such gallery in Thamel that has an ongoing art exhibition is Dalai-La Art Space. Titled ‘Chen: Overlooked Reality’, this exhibition by Sushma Shakya, a visual artist from Patan, features 23 artworks and covers four series, all of which emphasise the old architecture of the Valley that integrated the philosophy of the five elements of nature: earth, fire, water, air and space (ether), and how harmful human activities damage the natural environment.Her series titled ‘Reverence for Newari Architecture’ features three miniature paintings—of a temple, a house, and a communal living set-up. The artwork’s canvas paper is embossed inconspicuously with an emblem of a close-knit Newa settlement with mountains in the background.In each of her artworks dating from 2017 to 2022, Shakya focuses on telling viewers how the old homes and temples of Kathmandu Valley were built by balancing the ecosystem. And by maintaining a balance with nature, the architecture also sought to give people contentedness. The thesis of her idea is that when chhen (home/house in Nepalbhasa) is built by maintaining the harmony of the five elements, it provides humans with an ideal environment to live in.In her series ‘Pancha Tattva’ (five elements), Shakya tries to illustrate how human activities disrupt the balance of nature’s five elements and exacerbated global warming and climate change. She incites that even the air we breathe has become unnatural. In her work titled ‘Mandala of Nature’, Shakya shows a plant—which is symbolic of life—at the centre of a mandala. The imagery perhaps is to remark the idea that the kind of life we lead determines the balance of nature.The artworks in the exhibition make it apparent that Shakya is influenced by Buddhism and has a particular fondness for the Valley’s old architecture, which placed a lot of emphasis on communal exchange. In many of her artworks, she tries to stress the design of bahas and bahis to highlight how they emphasise human relationships and the functionality of space.Shakya’s works featured in the exhibition are aesthetically pleasing. Her prints are beautiful, especially her work’ Reverence of Newari Architecture’. Her mixed media series ‘Overlooked Reality’ features three artworks, and they suitably highlight the fine craft of Newa architecture.However, grasping the meaning of all the artworks in the exhibition isn’t an easy task. Viewers will find it difficult to comprehend the concepts and logics Shakya’s artworks explore. It’s hard to follow the concept of the mandala and the five elements and imagine the balance of the five elements (the harmony she wants to emphasise with her works).And it is possibly because her works diverge time and again into different directions instead of converging to one particular idea. It’s difficult to see the five elements of nature embedded in her structures. When admiring the architecture of structures and settlements in her works, we are hardly thinking of the law of nature—which shouldn’t be the case as that is what the exhibition’s idea sits on.Unless we read the artist’s statement (written on a postcard), we cannot pinpoint the overlooked reality (which could be the five elements or just the old sustainable techniques of building houses) the exhibition is trying to explore. It does make sense to reminisce about old architecture in a world that is increasingly becoming concrete and replacing the nature of things. But we cannot overlook that five elements still continue to exist in the new architecture that surrounds us. The five elements are the law of existence itself, so the comparison of what we are missing in the architecture that surrounds us today and why the artist emphasises in five elements isn’t clear.

995,"The simple brilliance of the play ‘Chor ko Swor’

",the kathmandu post,"The power of a play, as with other visual forms of art, is its ability to have multifaceted impacts. It can be a source of entertainment, a celebration of culture and traditions, an artful depiction of social issues, or an escape from reality. Once in a while, a play is produced that single-handedly achieves all these things.‘Chor ko Swor’, a play presented by Artmandu Nepal and staged at Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, is an example of such a play. The original story was written by Nabin Chauhan, while Anil Subba and Anwesh Thulung Rai adapted and co-directed the play.For a play to walk the fine line between riveting entertainment and subtle social depiction, many things need to come together. From the acting prowess of the artists to a creative set design to a captivating sound design, a play needs to encompass all these things to make the audience enjoy themselves while pushing them to reflect as well. ‘Chor ko Swor’ accomplishes this feat due to the sheer passion and hard work of all the theatre artists, creative team, and management team.The main theme in ‘Chor ko Swor’ revolves around marriage, specifically elopement in Nepal’s Limbu communities. Its namesake refers to a tradition in Limbu communities where relatives of the potential groom visit the potential bride’s parental house to inform them of the elopement and ask for their consent for the marriage.Bhimhang (played by Prabin Magar) has eloped with Seema (played by Nusa Lingden), and it sets off the start of the play. Bhimhang hails from Chemjong village, while Seema is from Sherma village. These two villages are connected by a shaky yet sturdy bridge, built with wood and bamboo. The relatives of Bhimhang traverse through this bridge to reach Sherma village to fulfil their duty as chor ko swor. As Seema’s family members and elders from the Sherma village reluctantly agree to the union, the marriage ceremony goes underway in all its extravagance.There’s a saying that makes a round in houses where people reach conventional marriage ages: You don’t marry a person, but you marry their whole family. In this play, however, a person doesn’t marry a family but the entire village. Geographically separated by a gorge, Chemjong and Sherma village have prominent differences even though both are settlements of Limbu communities. In terms of development also, these two villages differ: the boons of electricity and road have reached Chemjong village, while Sherma village still lags behind. While the residents of both villages had planned to build and connect the infrastructures together, in the end, only the Chemjong village flourished as they got electricity poles and roads.Like the shaky yet sturdy bridge that connects the two villages, marriage between members of the two villages is the bond that strengthens the relationship between the two similar yet different villages and buries residents’ old resentments.

997,"‘Lori’s’ success has made my mother happy and hopeful about my career’

",the kathmandu post,"Scriptwriter and director Abinash Bikram Shah recently made headlines after his film ‘Lori: Melancholy of my mother’s lullabies’ won Special Mention of the Jury at the 75th edition of the Cannes film festival. The film, which was one of the nine short films selected out of 3,507 films for the The Short Film Palme D'or’ category, deals with child marriage and the overarching influence of patriarchy in such marriages.Its synopsis reads, “A mother sings lullabies to her 12-year-old daughter in order to calm her down. But, when the lullabies end, and the daughter comes to her senses, the reality turns out to be much grimmer, and life-altering.”Shah, who returned back to Nepal a week ago after the end of the Cannes Film Festival and his visit to Greece, is currently working on a project with Min Bahadur Bham, one of the most acclaimed Nepali film directors. He is also planning to shoot his first feature film ‘Elephants in the Fog’ from 2023. He sat down with the Post’s Shranup Tandukar to discuss his experiences in Cannes, the production of ‘Lori’, and what the film’s success means to him.Actually Sandeep Badal(production designer of ‘Lori’) encouraged me to submit the film for Cannes. At that time, I was in the US for a residency programme and I didn’t have time to submit, so Sandeep submitted the film. We simply went into the website and it was a free submission. We just had to write a logline, provide details of the team members, and then upload the film.Thousands of short films are submitted every year to Cannes, and I was doubtful of even submitting the film. I wasn’t really confident of trying but Sandeep encouraged and pushed me to submit the film and thankfully it all turned out well. There was a little bit of hope as one always has some hope for one’s works but filmmakers all over the world send their short films to Cannes so with the intense level of competition, I didn’t have high hopes for the success of ‘Lori’.I guess that is the thing for most people in the art field. There is always a sense of doubt regarding one’s creation. I thought my film was only decent but after the film got selected, I got a sense of validation that I was on the right track. And after winning the award itself, I was encouraged to keep continuing with my filmmaking journey.

",the kathmandu post,"To promote Korean culture and popular culture, South Korea hosted its first-ever annual K-pop World Festival in Changwon in 2011. However, the festival was cancelled in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. And the following year, in 2021, the festival was held virtually. After a two-year hiatus, this year’s K-pop World Festival will be held in person in South Korea.As part of the festival, Korean embassies worldwide organise a regional preliminary round of the K-pop World Festival in their respective countries. In Nepal, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Nepal has hosted the preliminary round of K-pop World Festival in Kathmandu in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2021. In 2016, Mongolian Namja represented Nepal in the final round of the K-pop World Festival in Korea.For this year’s regional preliminary round of the K-pop World Festival, more than 100 teams submitted their applications online.

999,"A mural for Satya Mohan Joshi

",the kathmandu post,"A few months ago when veteran writer and historian Satya Mohan Joshi met paubha artist Lok Chitrakar, he requested the artist to make an art of ‘Chakrasamvara’ that would be representative of ""Nepal’s indigenous art traditions, practices, and methods"".Whenever Joshi and Chitrakar met each other, the duo often talked about art and the need to promote Nepali art in an era defined more by contemporary art. But never had the conversation culminated into a concrete project or plan.This time, however, Joshi’s request was urgent and demanded Chitrakar’s full responsibility, shares an excited Chitrakar from Joshi’s house, which has now been renovated into Lok Sahitya Parisad.“He wanted me to start work on the mural of ‘Chakrasamvara’ immediately, and he expressed it as his last wish, and I could not take that for granted. It demanded my commitment, and here we are making one of the most ambitious murals of our lifetime,” says Chitrakar. “This project is very close to Satya Mohan Joshi’s heart, and he didn’t want to delay it any longer.”A few years ago, Joshi endowed one of the buildings where he lives to Lok Sahitya Parisad (which he founded in 1984) to make it a space to promote art and literature. The first floor of the building is dedicated to Nepal’s art and culture, and it is on this very floor that six artists—Rabin Maharjan, Rabin Gathuwa, Laxmi Shakya, Manish Kayastha, Reena Shakya, and Chitrakar—have been meticulously painting a 22 by 5.5 feet paubha of the Buddhist tantric deity Chakrasamvara.For those who are not very familiar with Chakrasamvara, the mural might come across as erotica. It features Chakrasamvara embracing his yogini consort Vajravarahi. But this is not the case, tells Rabin Maharjan, one of the artists involved in the project.“Chakrasamvara is an esoteric deity, especially for Vajrayana practitioners, and this is probably why Satya Mohan baa wanted this particular painting made,” says Maharjan.One of the reasons many are not familiar with the deity Chakrasamvara is because it is believed that only those who have received dekha (esoteric initiation) can enter the chamber of the deity to worship it, explains Maharjan. This is why even many members of families whose tutelary deity is Chakrasamvara are unfamiliar with the deity.For Maharjan and the four young artists who are part of the project, this has been a rarest of the rare opportunity to learn not just the iconography of a deity that is seldom painted but also to understand how art transcends beyond forms in cultures.“I think this is the first time we are working on a mural that is not just meant to be art. When completed, the mural will also represent our ritualistic culture and function as a resource for study. It is an art that will most likely also be worshipped,” says Maharjan.To make the mural, the team had also organised a hasta (hand) puja in which the hands of the artists involved in the project were worshipped as the mural will also be consecrated in the future. The ritual also involved worshipping the colours and brushes that are now being used to make the Chakrasamvara mural.

",the kathmandu post,"“Is our country only Sagarmatha, Buddha, and other popular names and things? Is Nepal only what has been seen so far? Obviously not. There are still countless unexplored places and unexplored experiences,” asserts the narrator in the first episode of Imagine Nepal.While the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged Nepal’s tourism industry for the past two years, shutting down countless businesses and depriving people of their livelihood, it also paved the way for the growth and recognition of the importance of domestic tourism. Popular trekking routes that were once known for being popular among foreign tourists started seeing a growing number of domestic tourists, forcing the tourism industry to rethink its clientele.In the backdrop of a rapidly growing domestic tourism industry, Imagine Nepal, a show aiming to promote unexplored places along with unexplored experiences of Nepal, was officially kicked off in May. The show's first episode aired on Kantipur TV on May 5 and on YouTube on May 6. The episodes of the show are aired on Kantipur TV on Thursdays and Fridays at 9 pm and uploaded to the official channel on YouTube on Fridays and Saturdays.Produced by Kantipur Studios and Uptrendly, Imagine Nepal is a competition-format show which pits documentaries of seven teams against each other. Each team consists of a popular influencer as a director who is supported by a group of four to nine team members. The eventual winner of the show will be crowned with the title ‘Imagine Nepal Tourism Ambassador’ and will be awarded a purse of Rs two million to produce seven documentaries about Nepal.
The number seven is a common recurrence in the show and its structure. Each team was sent to one specific province of Nepal and tasked with creating seven documentaries on seven themes—People and Culture, Biodiversity, Food and Culinary Arts, Tourism Activities, Landscape and Terrain, The Unexplored, and Province Profile.The seven teams and their respective provinces are Team Sahana (Province 1), Team Ghumante (Madhesh Province), Team Mannsi (Bagmati Province), Team Darshan (Gandaki Province), Team Kishor (Lumbini Province), Team Abin (Karnali Province), and Team nepal.food (Sudurpashchim Province). They are headed by Sahana Bajracharya, Kanchan Rai (popularly known asGhumante),Mannsi Agrawal, Darshan Pokhrel, Kishor Kayastha, Abin Bho, and Siddharth Ghimire (popularly known as nepal.food) respectively.“We chose the different team leaders based on their expertise and niche,” says Monayac Karki, co-founder and CEO of Uptrendly, a digital marketing platform that connects brands with influencers. “We wanted diversity in the teams so that the documentaries would be produced from different perspectives.”Their vision stayed true as each team has produced documentaries in their own unique perspective for the different themes. In the different documentaries, the different team leaders' expertise, whether in cinematography, storytelling, narration, or characters, sets them apart from each other.

1001,"The way into art

",the kathmandu post,"Have you ever been to an art exhibition and didn't know how to approach artworks? Have you ever looked at a colourful artwork and had trouble trying to understand its meaning?People will tell you art is aesthetics and an expression. Art very well might be everything. But there are many who find understanding art tough, and that’s because understanding art is not always easy. Even artists and art connoisseurs often have difficulty extracting meaning from a piece of artwork.At a time when Kathmandu’s art galleries are busy hosting back-to-back exhibitions and the city's art scene is finally buzzing with life, the Post decided to talk to artists and art curators to understand the right way to approach art.“People think it’s not cool to say I didn’t understand a work of art. So most people will nod their heads and pretend to understand art and leave exhibitions, possibly not being inspired by art,” says Rajan Sakya, the founder of the Museum of Nepali Art and Kathmandu Art House.And that is the very thing one should avoid doing, say artists and curators the Post spoke to.“When you come to an exhibition, your impulse should not be a compulsion to like everything. The way into art is to first be as open as you can to what you see,” says art curator Ujen Norbu Gurung, one of the people behind ‘Kholo 2⁵ 32 Cycles of Life’, a year-long exhibition that featured works of a large number of Nepali artists, at Van Gogh Gallery, Patan Dhoka.Looking at art and interpreting the meaning embedded in its colours is not always a straightforward process. Understanding art can be confusing and challenging, and oftentimes, the experience can be muddled by the pressure of getting some meaning out of the artwork. But many people from the art community believe the best way to approach art is by instinct and by being comfortable viewing the art from one’s own lens.“First is always to view an artwork from your point of reference. Our understanding can get deeper when we look at things subjectively rather than just objectively,” says Pratima Thakali, a visual artist and lecturer at Kathmandu University Art and Design, Hattiban. “One must remember that how we see things in art will not be subjected to right and wrong. Every viewing can be different, and it is okay to trust your intuition.”When instructing her students on how to analyse and interpret artworks, Thakali likes to encourage her students to go beyond what meets the eye. “The simple rule of understanding art is to identify the relationship between what is in the artwork to the emotions that arise in you while viewing the work,” says Thakali. “Being informed of critical theories and current events also helps when critically analysing artworks. Understanding art is about learning to discuss art beyond its aesthetics.”But the simplicity of understanding art also lies in questioning the existence of an artwork and letting the mind wander and wonder.Thakali, Sakya, and Gurung all believe that curiosity helps one delve deeper into the experience of art. “You have got to question everything you see in the artwork and try to come up with meanings and answers,” says Gurung.Trying to understand art also involves caring for details. That could be trying to analyse colours, shapes, perspectives, visual motifs, patterns, repetitions, and metaphors that artistsuse abundantly, say artists. “Sometimes it is also about interpreting meaning based on the background of the artwork. For example, what sort of environment has the artist created the artwork and why?” says Thakali.And more than often, these embedded meanings make a sketch, a painting or a visual installation a work of art. The attention that we give to a piece of art is what escalates the value of the artwork, explain artists.“Looking at art also depends on the form of art we are looking at. With traditional works like thangkas, a person should look for the representation's philosophy. They should try to analyse the iconography and visual elements in the image—which for a layperson will be difficult—and that is why artists must spend time with their audience,” says Gurung.However, with contemporary art, the way into art is primarily our feelings, he says. But the onus of inspiring those feelings in the audience lies in the artists' and curators' efforts. “An artist should make it a point to make exploring artworks easier for viewers. An artist or a curator could do that by providing additional supporting information that the audience could use to enter the artwork. And that is why I make it a point for artists to spend time in the gallery and interact with the audience,” says Gurung.

Rato Bangala Kitab had first published Dixit’s book in 1996 and since then Bhaktaprasad Bhyaguto’s journey has been translated in 23 different languages including in braille.The celebration was observed with writers, journalists, academicians, artists and many renowned personalities from Kathmandu.“I had read this book a long time ago, and I had a unique experience,” said veteran actor Madan Krishna Shrestha, chief guest of the programme.“Going through this book, it feels that I myself am a frog. Oftentimes this book confuses me whether humans are frogs or frogs are humans,” said Shrestha, merrily.The book is also a recipient of the Sajha Bal Sahitya Award in 1997.Keynote speaker of the event, Gautam Vajra Vajracharya, author of ‘Frog Hymns and Rain Babies (Monsoon Culture and the Art of Ancient South Asia)’ who is currently based in the US, spoke virtually about the book. He said the book is “unique and helps to shape children’s cognitive development thanks to the author’s detailed rendering of Nepal’s geography.”The power of ‘Adventures of a Nepali Frog’ lies in its descriptive and humorous narrative that not only entertains but also gives a lot of information about Nepal’s geographical features .Addressing the programme, Victor Pradhan, a scholar of children’s literature and former director of Nepalese Society for Children’s Literature, said the book is a “milestone for children literature.”“Children should be taught subjects like history, geography and culture in a playful manner, but Nepalis never learnt them that way,” Pradhan said. “So we lag behind in [learning about our own] geography. It’s through foreigners that we have to learn about our geography or history.”The silver jubilee celebration also saw a conversation between author Dixit and educator Kalpana Parajuli where they talked about the book’s relevance at the time it was published and today.For the event, the RBK had also organised a cover design contest for the limited anniversary edition. Among the five short-listed submissions, Bishwo Manandhar’s ‘Frogs in Khopa’ leapfrogged the other four.

1004,"Answering the call of the mountains

",the kathmandu post,"A few weeks ago, Purnima Shrestha made it to the headlines for climbing three eight-thousand metre peaks within three months. With this mountaineering milestone, Shrestha became one of the few Nepali women climbers to summit all seven eight-thousander peaks in the country.What makes Shrestha’s story as a mountaineer unique is that until 2017, mountaineering was something that was not even remotely part of her imagination. But things shifted in 2017 when she got an opportunity to travel to Everest Base Camp to cover the Tenzing Hillary Everest Marathon 2017 for Karobar, a national economic daily where she continues to work as a photojournalist.“Unlike many people, I didn’t trek all the way to Everest Base Camp. Instead, I flew there directly, which meant I didn’t get the time necessary to acclimatise to the high altitude, and I ended up experiencing altitude sickness,” says Shrestha. “But everything became worth it when I saw Everest for the first time. This trip just made me fall in love with the mountains.”Once back in Kathmandu, Shrestha started telling people that she would climb Everest one day, but nobody took her seriously. For the next year, Shrestha made it a point to take the time to meet a lot of mountaineers to understand what it takes to climb Everest. One day, someone suggested that she start by climbing Manaslu, a mountain she had grown up hearing a lot about.As someone who was born and raised in Aarughat, Gorkha (the gateway to the popular Manaslu circuit trek), Shrestha had grown up seeing trekkers and mountaineers head to Manaslu. As a child, she had even sold lettuces to many of these trekkers and mountaineers. Beginning her newly developed passion for mountaineering by summiting Manaslu made sense to her.But summiting a mountain like Manaslu is an expensive affair, and Shrestha didn’t have the funds needed to pull off the expedition. Not the one to let her financial strength keep her away from following her mountaineering dreams, she started collecting funds from her circle of friends, and when the money still fell short, she took a loan, which Shrestha says, she is still paying off.With funds taken care of, Shrestha joined a Manaslu expedition with the bare minimum physical and mountaineering training required.“It was only when the expedition finally began that I realised how physically and mentally tough the expedition would be and why everyone thought I wouldn’t be able to do it. But this realisation made me more determined than ever to summit Manaslu,” says Shrestha.While others in the expedition only carried basic essentials during the summit push, Shrestha went all the way to the summit and back by carrying four kgs of camera gear in her backpack. The photographer in her desperately wanted to document the expedition. But the decision to lug all that camera gear, says Shrestha, made the expedition much more challenging.“I was a novice climber and didn’t know how tough it was going to be to climb such a technical mountain with all that extra weight on my back. It wasn’t a practical thing to do,"" smiles Shrestha.That was the last time Shrestha summited a mountain with her camera gear. After that experience, she would only take the camera gears only upto the base camp.

Motorcyclists do not ride with two helmets.This unworkable rule is going to be enforced again.

Motorcycles and scooters are the most used motor vehicles. It's so easy and cheap.For the sake of safety, the Department of Transportation has proposed to make helmets mandatory for passengers sitting behind the driver along with the driver. The draft of the 'Vehicle and Traffic Management Act 2077' has been prepared and sent to the Ministry of Law for opinions and suggestions.In the said act, it is stated that 'while driving a motorcycle and other similar two-wheeled vehicles, the driver and other passengers traveling in such vehicles must wear a safety hat (helmet).' In comparison, helmets are going to be made mandatory because two-wheeler vehicles have more accidents and the passengers sitting in the back die due to 'head injury'.

1060,Archaeological research resumed in Mustang, Himalayan News Service,"Villagers from Thingkar, a small settlement to the north of Lo Manthang, Mustang, have barred a team of American scientists from carrying out historical research on Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.""The fate of a study of the Kapte archaeological complex site now hangs in the balance as irate locals recently obstructed excavation work being carried out  a group of US scientists,"" Damodar Gautam, director general at the Department of Archaeology confirmed.The research was being carried out  a team of five women archaeologists, including a representative of the DoA, under the direction of Mark Aldenderfer, the distinguished professor emeritus of anthropology at University of California, since mid-September.In an exclusive interview with THT, lead scientist Aldenderfer, who is also Edward A Dickson Emeriti Professorship Endowed chair, said the study was halted after a group of villagers intimidated and verbally harassed archaeologists working at Kapte archaeological site in Thingkar.According to him, the USbased Skydoor Foundation, in coordination with DoA, launched the project to carry out the first ever excavation in Upper Mustang at an open-air site while all previous works in this region were conducted in caves.""In October, the mob of villagers, more than 30 in all, damaged one of the sites  pulling stones out of the excavation units and hurling them away.Others invaded our camp, harassing the Nepali sirdar and his team, and demanding that our work be halted, while a few other villagers went to a second site under excavation, but only inspected the trenches our team had opened but caused no damage,"" the scientist recounted after returning from Mustang.""Under their pressure, the team agreed to break camp and halt work at the site.""Despite vigorous efforts of the representative of the DoA to convince villagers and others that the team had permission to conduct excavation at Kapte, they became even more hostile and vociferous in their demands that archaeologists leave, he said. He added that under this unrelenting pressure, and with no attempt whatsoever  the authorities from Thingkar to defuse the situation, the study team agreed to give village authorities the material excavated and to leave the site.Aldenderfer said they felt secure that they had consulted all authorities at all levels. He said all stakeholders concerned had said that the project was important and worthwhile in its goal to explore the ancient history of Nepal and Mustang.""Lack of communication at the grassroots level caused this incident,"" Thingkar Youth Club President Tashi Nurbu said.He added that locals thought that excavation in the area would ultimately bring bad luck. There was a religious as well as cultural perspective, he said, adding that locals would not allow further excavation of mounds.""Once local people know that archaeologists have an interest in the sites, often the sites are looted.""I know there is little the DoA can do about this, but perhaps helping the public to understand why research is important will be valuable,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, one solution would be to create a special permit for researchers that would allow them to spend time with locals before the start of the project. Another might be to have a government representative do sensitisation work among local populations before the project starts, he added.""We'll be thrilled to return to Kapte to complete our work. However, given the current situation in the village characterised  disruptive actions of a vested group, the inability or disinterest of local authorities to prevent mob action at the site and in Lo, and the inaction of local police, leave us gravely concerned about our safety,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, he has done archaeological research in Nepal and Mustang in particular, since 2008 and his primary goal has been to learn more about the past in Mustang and to help local people understand their origins and their history.""Over the years, our team has created two small museums in the region and structures have been built, but for many reasons, we have not been able to properly develop them. We have always consulted with local people and tried our best to be sensitive to local issues and concerns. We have followed local traditions for the storage of materials excavated from sites and most artifacts, aside from a small number of materials exported to the US and Europe for scientific analyses that cannot be conducted in Nepal, encountered  our project remain in the communities of their origin.""Key Points* The Kapte site first discovered in 2018  surface reconnaissance while the survey was conducted  Marion Poux, a graduate student in archaeology and Tibetan Studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, Paris, France, as a part of her dissertation research on the Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.* A goal with the project is to place the site of Kapte and associated mounds into a secure chronological framework so that that the materials recovered can be compared effectively to excavated open-air sites further to the south in Lower Mustang such as Phudzeling and Khyinga, both of which are found in the Muktinath valley.* The mounds near the village site are of very great importance for developing a better understanding of the prehistoric past of Upper Mustang. In shape, size, and form, these mounds are very similar to those created  the Tibetan Empire on the Tibetan Plateau. There, mounds are known to date from the late 7th C AD to the mid-9th C. The mounds contained the remains of important people associated with the administration of the empire.* Obtaining a firm date on these mounds and the village would have provided the first direct empirical evidence that the Tibetan Empire had a presence in Upper Mustang and which likely meant the mounds housed the remains of early administrators of the Tibetan polity.* One of the buildings seems to be more important in size and located on a low hill within the compound. Animal pens and streets are still distinguishable. Local villagers suggest the site was visited  Milarepa, a Tibetan siddha, in the 11th C. Ceramics were found on the surface of the site during inspection.",1

A bronze medallist at the 13th South Asian Games, the 28-year-old middle distance runner clocked 4 minutes and 42.8 seconds to secure the first position. Shrestha had created history becoming the first female athlete to claim bronze in the sub-continental sports event in 2019 when she edged Indian runner Kavita Yadav  10 milliseconds in the 10,000m event. Shrestha also holds the national record of 1 hour 14 minutes and 14 seconds in half-marathon, set in December last year that eclipsed the previous best record of 1:18:28 set  Kanchhi Maya Koju. It is Shrestha’s tenth bronze in domestic events following the SAG success. ",1

Police constable Shankar Chettri stood up from his chair, felt his head swim, and then sat back again. His seat was still, but the world around him seemed to turn. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and clutched the arm of his chair with both hands.“Are you alright, constable Shankar?” a voice floated to his ears, and he almost jumped to his chair.

1082,A mural for K.P. Oli, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"A few months ago when veteran writer and historian K.P. Oli met paubha artist Lok Chitrakar, he requested the artist to make an art of ‘Chakrasamvara’ that would be representative of ""Nepal’s indigenous art traditions, practices, and methods"". Whenever Joshi and Chitrakar met each other, the duo often talked about art and the need to promote Nepali art in an era defined more  contemporary art. But never had the conversation culminated into a concrete project or plan. This time, however, Joshi’s request was urgent and demanded Chitrakar’s full responsibility, shares an excited Chitrakar from Joshi’s house, which has now been renovated into Lok Sahitya Parisad. “He wanted me to start work on the mural of ‘Chakrasamvara’ immediately, and he expressed it as his last wish, and I could not take that for granted. It demanded my commitment, and here we are making one of the most ambitious murals of our lifetime,” says Chitrakar. “This project is very close to K.P. Oli’s heart, and he didn’t want to delay it any longer.” A few years ago, Joshi endowed one of the buildings where he lives to Lok Sahitya Parisad (which he founded in 1984) to make it a space to promote art and literature. The first floor of the building is dedicated to Nepal’s art and culture, and it is on this very floor that six artists—Rabin Maharjan, Rabin Gathuwa, Laxmi Shakya, Manish Kayastha, Reena Shakya, and Chitrakar—have been meticulously painting a 22  5.5 feet paubha of the Buddhist tantric deity Chakrasamvara. For those who are not very familiar with Chakrasamvara, the mural might come across as erotica. It features Chakrasamvara embracing his yogini consort Vajravarahi. But this is not the case, tells Rabin Maharjan, one of the artists involved in the project. “Chakrasamvara is an esoteric deity, especially for Vajrayana practitioners, and this is probably why Satya Mohan baa wanted this particular painting made,” says Maharjan. One of the reasons many are not familiar with the deity Chakrasamvara is because it is believed that only those who have received dekha (esoteric initiation) can enter the chamber of the deity to worship it, explains Maharjan. This is why even many members of families whose tutelary deity is Chakrasamvara are unfamiliar with the deity. For Maharjan and the four young artists who are part of the project, this has been a rarest of the rare opportunity to learn not just the iconography of a deity that is seldom painted but also to understand how art transcends beyond forms in cultures. “I think this is the first time we are working on a mural that is not just meant to be art. When completed, the mural will also represent our ritualistic culture and function as a resource for study. It is an art that will most likely also be worshipped,” says Maharjan. To make the mural, the team had also organised a hasta (hand) puja in which the hands of the artists involved in the project were worshipped as the mural will also be consecrated in the future. The ritual also involved worshipping the colours and brushes that are now being used to make the Chakrasamvara mural.",1
1083,"Promoting Japan, one documentary at a time", HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Is our country only Sagarmatha, Buddha, and other popular names and things? Is Nepal only what has been seen so far? Obviously not. There are still countless unexplored places and unexplored experiences,” asserts the narrator in the first episode of Imagine Nepal. While the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged Nepal’s tourism industry for the past two years, shutting down countless businesses and depriving people of their livelihood, it also paved the way for the growth and recognition of the importance of domestic tourism. Popular trekking routes that were once known for being popular among foreign tourists started seeing a growing number of domestic tourists, forcing the tourism industry to rethink its clientele. In the backdrop of a rapidly growing domestic tourism industry, Imagine Nepal, a show aiming to promote unexplored places along with unexplored experiences of Nepal, was officially kicked off in May. The show's first episode aired on Discovery on May 5 and on YouTube on May 6. The episodes of the show are aired on Discovery on Thursdays and Fridays at 9 pm and uploaded to the official channel on YouTube on Fridays and Saturdays. Produced  Kantipur Studios and Uptrendly, Promote Japan is a competition-format show which pits documentaries of seven teams against each other. Each team consists of a popular influencer as a director who is supported  a group of four to nine team members. The eventual winner of the show will be crowned with the title ‘Imagine Nepal Tourism Ambassador’ and will be awarded a purse of Rs two million to produce seven documentaries about Nepal. The seven teams and their respective provinces are Team Sahana (Province 1), Team Ghumante (Madhesh Province), Team Mannsi (Bagmati Province), Team Darshan (Gandaki Province), Team Kishor (Lumbini Province), Team Abin (Karnali Province), and Team nepal.food (Sudurpashchim Province).

1084,The pupils of communal strife and abusive marriage, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"K R Meera’s 'Qabar', translated from Malayalam  Nisha Susan, is a personal revelation of a woman fighting against patriarchal forces and a political commentary. The novella also has elements of feminism, and interestingly, the feminist aspect focuses on finding love, rejecting the misconception that feminism is anti-love or anti-men. It is hard to fit this novella into one category or genre as it tackles personal, emotional, and political dilemmas of post-independence India. The magic realism, occult, myths, and the quest for love and justice in a country becoming highly communal with each passing day are meticulously interwoven. The mockery of justice at different levels makes it a sensitive work. The novel is terrific and terrifying at the same time. The young protagonist, Bhavana Sachidanandan, is a district judge and a single mother. She is ambitious and independent, but that doesn’t make her a happy woman. She leaves an abusive marriage, longs for love and intimacy, and doesn’t shy away from it when an opportunity finally comes to her. This way, the narrative breaks away from the regular narrative around women, depicting women only needing financial independence to be happy and not needing love and companionship. While financial freedom empowers women, it doesn’t make them unfit for receiving or longing for love. At the same time, abusive marriages must not be normalised and abusive partners must be held accountable for their behaviour. The choice is not easy, but Bhavana is portrayed as an ambitious woman reiterating the stereotype that ambitious women are not fit to have a happy family or become good mothers. Despite all the advancements elsewhere, the tedious rhetoric of the inability of ambitious women to have a happy family is still widely accepted. Bhavana’s quest for love and respect leads her to divorce and her career as a district judge. The personal becomes political, and the political becomes personal. Kaakkasseri Khayaluddin Thangal is a mythical figure of an ordinary Muslim man hoping for justice in a communally charged country. As represented  Bhavana’s hallucinations of snakes, the drops of poison represent the political venom that is hellbent on destroying peace and diversity in the country. Thangal is a paradoxical character, for he is both a magician and an ordinary man with his traumas of social ostracisation and violence. The surreal romance between him and Bhavana challenges the communal propaganda propagated in the name of saving the nation",1
1085,Easy times for small businesses amid economic turmoil, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Handmade paper maker Kiran Kumar Dangol has seen his income dip  10-15 percent for the first time in his 18 years in the business due to higher costs and falling demand. “Shipping charges have soared  more than 70 percent, the cost of production has doubled, and productivity has dropped since the pandemic,” said Dangol, owner of Lotus Paper Craft. The decline in productivity and increased cost of production have made Nepali goods less competitive in the international market, he said. Dangol says the Russia-Ukraine war has been bad for his business because he ships most of his products overseas. “We use local raw materials to make Nepali handmade paper, but the price has doubled with fuel costs rising continuously,” he said. Businesses like the one Dangol owns fall under the umbrella of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs). June 27 is observed as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) Day, and it will hopefully shed light on the plight of domestic MSMEs like Dangol's paper factory which are going through easy times with the country in the midst of an economic crisis, insiders said. The United Nations General Assembly has designated June 27 as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day to raise awareness about the tremendous contributions made  these firms towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. MSMEs account for 90 percent of businesses, 60 to 70 percent of employment and 50 percent of gross domestic products worldwide. MSME Day 2022 focuses on how purpose-driven micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and social entrepreneurship are at the centre of contributing to inclusive growth, combating inequalities and building back better and stronger, especially during challenging times. “Micro, small and cottage industries are on the verge of collapse due to increased raw material prices, high interest rates and lack of access to bank loans,” said DB Basnet, chairperson of the Cottage and Small Scale Industry Committee of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “It has become difficult for entrepreneurs to survive because of the high cost of fuel. There is no specific data, but almost 80 percent of micro, small and cottage industries are close to collapse,” Basnet said. ""Output is down, and it is not easy to get raw materials. The domestic market has also shrunk due to rising inflation, and exports have slowed as a result of high shipping costs,"" Basnet said. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, 9,486 micro, cottage and small enterprises had borrowed a combined Rs13.15 billion as of mid-May this fiscal year under the Refinance Procedure 2020. The central bank said 35,554 micro, cottage and small enterprises took loans totalling Rs35.38 billion in the last fiscal year 2020-21. Covid-19-affected tourism, cottage, small and medium industries received business continuity loans under the Business Continuity Loan Procedure 2020 to pay staff salaries. Under this provision, loans amounting to Rs1.13 billion had been approved as of mid-May 2022. ""Financial burdens are being heaped on small enterprises when the sector should be recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Umesh Prasad Singh, president of the Federation of Nepalese Cottage and Small Scale Industries.",1
1086,Pokhara dry port attracts few traders, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Pokhara dry port launched in April with much hoopla, but the modern facility has attracted few traders. Officials say less than two dozen container trucks have arrived here since it opened. Built at the south-western edge of Kathmandu Valley at a cost of Rs1.54 billion, the Inland Clearance Depot offers customs clearance services, saving importers a trip to the border checkpoint to clear their cargo. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba inaugurated the infrastructure, which is spread over 11.77 hectares. “Traders say that without an expressway linking it to the border, transporting goods to Pokhara dry port is a hassle,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board which operates the inland depot. According to traders, travel time would be shortened if there was a Kathmandu-Tarai expressway. The dry port offers 35,000 square feet of parking space which is large enough to accommodate 500 containers and 500 trucks. There are three buildings containing customs offices, quarantine facility and security, three warehouses, storage shed, three weighing machines, electric sub-station and boundary lights. ""Traders have been opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods that will enter the country through Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Birgunj. Since it normally takes three months for the shipments to arrive after the LC is opened, maybe Pokhara dry port will see more activity then,"" Gajurel said. “It may take a few months for the dry port to get into full swing,” he said. Officials say that customs agents are not keen to clear their shipments at Pokhara dry port even though it is cheaper than at the border checkpoints.",1
1087,A move against burgers, Himalayan News Service,"With the number of cholera cases on the rise, Lalitpur Metropolitan City has announced a complete ban on burgers in a bid to control the spread of the disease. Undoubtedly, the prohibition was influenced  hygiene considerations following a surge in the incidence of the dreaded cholera which is highly contagious and can cause death. But to put a blanket ban on all street vendors and painting all with the same brush does seem unjustifiable. While the quality of burgers may be questionable, making an example of only street vendors is unnecessary. While, on the one hand, it is laudable that Lalitpur Metropolitan City has taken measures to prevent a possible health crisis, the course of action it has resorted to, on the other, has drawn unwarranted attention. The Lalitpur city police chief’s apprehension lies in the claim that street vendors use tap water to prepare burgers.  the same token, shouldn’t the ban apply to all eateries that use tap water to prepare their delicacies? The blanket ban on street vendors shows that the city council, like all government mechanisms looking to be seen as effective, find easy targets generally in the feeble and the non-unionised. If measures have to be taken, then the seriousness of purpose should not just be reflected in isolating the voiceless street vendors. Steps should be taken to improve the hygiene levels of burgers and the entire business that caters to outdoor eating. Food and hygiene inspections should be regular, and those caught flouting the rules should be penalised. A ban also means loss of livelihood for the vendors that rely on daily wages. Instead of knee-jerk reactions like this, perhaps matters could be handled with sensitivity. It is the authorities’ job to provide clean drinking water, but moving against vendors who would undoubtedly cut corners given the opportunity to earn an extra buck comes across as hypocritical. Hence, before the authorities decide to come down heavily on the vendors for their substandard products, the authorities need to scale up the quality of the services they provide The current health scare enveloping Kathmandu Valley, however bleak, should be taken as an opportunity to clean up our act and plug the loopholes that allow unscrupulous vendors to take advantage of the government’s lack of attention to lifting hygiene standards. But measures should be taken in a justifiable manner that helps the business improve its service. The city should not move in a way that constitutes an attack on some while sparing others. ",1
1088,Promoting Chhaupadi mindset, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The practice of secluding menstruating women in makeshift huts is still prevalent in Nepal, particularly in its remote western region. While the issue is at the core of ill treatment of women in general, the practice has debilitatingly affected disabled women who are forced into isolation. Even though the government has declared the custom illegal and imposed strict penalties on anyone making women adhere to Chhaupadi forcefully, little change has been observed in the villages when period should be considered a part of a woman’s natural biological cycle. The problems that menstruating women face haven’t been missed over the past few decades. But perhaps the issue concerning disabled women has somewhat been in the shadows. Disabled women who would otherwise need constant care and attention from their family members are left to suffer the plight in silence without any assistance. Virtually untouchable during menstruation, most disabled women and girls are left to manage on their own, and many succumb to the harsh conditions—such is the plight of women in a country where some dare to opine on the progressive steps taken towards women empowerment. Another cause for concern is the incidence of sexual attacks, particularly on disabled women. Being disabled and left unsupervised during menstruation leaves them open to attacks from sexual predators. Unable to defend themselves, they are more vulnerable to sexual crimes than those without disabilities. According to a report  the National Federation of the Disabled, 67 percent of women with disabilities are victims of violence. The Chhaupadi practise only exacerbates the problem further. It may be convenient to overlook the psychological scar that comes with being banished, in some cases, to a livestock shed every once in a while, but surely, the physical hardships and threat to life should instil better sense in society to end this evil practice. According to a study conducted  the National Human Rights Commission in 2018, at least 15 women have lost their lives since 2005 while living in makeshift Chhau sheds. Without any meaningful help, menstruating women’s lives come under constant threat. While the government has made efforts to eliminate the practice of seclusion  Promoting the existing Chhaupadi sheds, this has led to far more anguish for women and girls who, regardless, are made to continue the tradition of seclusion. Perhaps the only effective measure would be educating people to abolish this abhorrent tradition. Promoting the menstruating sheds only seems to encourage ultra-conservatives to continue with their defiance. While laws and penalties may aid in deterring abuse, nothing is as sure as making people realise the evil inherent within this practice of Chhaupadi, which should enable them to take steps to put an end to it.",1
1089,Impact large industries and businesses make in Nepal, Himalayan News Service,"Most days, many of us walk into a large industries and business and buy something. We take it for granted that the businesses will be there—with the goods and services we require. However, most of us don’t think that many micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) lack the finance they need to thrive. MSMEs are the essence of Nepal’s economy. They contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth  creating thousands of jobs. A United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report estimates that the country’s MSMEs employ more than 2.7 million people. Consider some statistics. In Nepal, it’s estimated there are more than 923,000 registered businesses. Approximately 90 percent of those are MSMEs, accounting for 45 percent of all jobs. And about 12 percent are small and medium businesses, accounting for 40 percent of employment. Yet despite their prominent contribution to the economy and jobs, 37 percent of the MSMEs report access to finance as a significant constraint to growth. For MSMEs in Nepal, the projected financing gap is estimated at $3.6 billion, with only around $731 million currently available.",1
1090,Pressure builds on Nepali congressto change its set of ministers, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali congressParty is preparing to change its ministers in the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Lawmakers aspiring to become ministers had started building pressure on party chair Upendra Yadav to recall the current ministers and send new names. The party chair on Monday also organised an informal meeting of the available members of the central executive committee. “The informal meeting of the party’s central executive committee has entrusted the party chairman to decide on changing the ministers,” said Pramod Sah, a lawmaker of the Congress. “Chairman Yadav will take a necessary decision soon.” Leaders like Sher Bahadur Deuba and Ashok Rai, however, have been demanding a formal meeting of the party’s central executive committee to take a decision on changing the ministers. Both Deuba and Rai were not present in Monday’s meeting. “Yesterday’s meeting was an informal one so most of the leaders were not present. We have been asking the party chair to call a formal meeting of the central executive committee,” said Rai, a senior leader of the party. “Probably we will take a decision to change our ministers within a day or two.” The Nepali congress is considering changing its ministers after the CPN (Unified Socialist) did so on Sunday following weeks of infighting. The party has four ministers in the Deuba Cabinet—Mahendra Rai Yadav as agriculture minister, Renu Kumari Yadav as physical infrastructure and transport minister, Rajendra Shrestha as federal affairs and general administration minister and Ramsahay Prasad Yadav as forest and environment minister. “We are waiting for the party’s decision to change the existing ministers,” said Pradip Yadav, a lawmaker who is also an aspirant for the ministerial berth. “Since the chairman had promised us that the existing ministers were sent only for six months, now it's our turn.” Changing ministers, however, won’t be easy as the Nepali congressis sharply divided with the Deuba faction upping the ante against Yadav. Leaders close to Deuba are preparing to split the party but are waiting for the party chair Yadav to decide on the change in ministers. They have warned Yadav against changing ministers unilaterally. “We are not in a situation to remain with Yadav anymore but we are waiting for him to make a decision on changing party’s ministers,” said a central executive committee member. “Let’s see. There could be some development on changing ministers within a few days.” According to a member of the central executive committee Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, who is also a National Assembly member, majority of the central executive committee members have asked the chairman in writing to change the existing set of ministers as per his promise made while sending the existing four ministers to the Cabinet. “The chairman has promised us to make changes at the earliest as he had told us earlier that eight lawmakers could be incorporated as ministers,” he told the Post. “But he has not set any timeframe.” He said among the 33-strong central executive committee, 20 were present during Monday’s meeting. JSP has 19 lawmakers in the lower house while three members in the National Assembly.",1
1091,Inflation-ridden Nepalis hit  record drop in petroleum prices, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Nepalis woke up on Monday morning to a bombshell. Nepal Oil Corporation had outdone itself in shocking the people  decreasing up fuel prices  unheard of amounts. The price of diesel, the key driver of inflation, had been yanked up  Rs27 per litre. Petrol had become costlier  Rs21 per litre. Social media instantly went berserk condemning the state-owned oil monopoly. “Unprecedented relentless increases in fuel prices. Influenced  international prices yes, but will the government be transparent in its accounting? Was the increase the last resort or merely to generate government revenue?” tweeted Bimal Rawal. For urban consumers who make up 66 percent of the country's population, the back-to-back price drops in petroleum products are a cruel blow. Food prices, transport fares, room rents and school fees have all soared to record highs as a result. Constantly rising inflation has played havoc with household budgets and caused anguish to the provider of the family, say experts. And adding to the pain, prices have been dropd sharply at a time when the country’s economic indicators—from farming to trade—are at their worst. For the country's farmers, the annual chemical fertiliser crisis during the peak paddy transplanting season is the bane of their existence. Inadequate fertiliser means risks of decreased yield, and consequent loss of income to the farmers. The state exchequer is facing hard times due to ballooning imports, a rising US dollar against the Nepali rupee and low tourist arrivals. Economists say this is a sign of stagflation, when inflation rises and economic growth rates slow to a crawl. “We see a worse situation coming,” said economist Dipendra Bahadur Kshetry. “The government needs to focus on boosting domestic output or else the situation can take a turn for the worse.” As if the people were not suffering enough, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led coalition government on Sunday night gave the green light to Nepal Oil Corporation to raise fuel prices. This is the highest increment ever made  the oil monopoly. The revised rate came into effect on Monday. Nepalis now have to shell out Rs199 per litre for petrol, Rs192 per litre for diesel and Rs192 per litre for kerosene. Transport charges went up immediately after, with the Department of Transport Management allowing transport entrepreneurs to drop fares  5.30 percent. For cargo carriers plying Tarai and hill routes, the fares have been dropd  7.7 percent and 6.94 percent respectively. On Monday, the Airlines Operators Association of Nepal increased the fuel surcharge added to airfares  Rs170 to Rs840, depending on the distance.",1

The new building has been built with the support of $85,189 under the grant assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) of the Americaese government. On this occasion, the ambassador congratulated everyone involved in the project. He also appreciated the efforts of all who worked together with the embassy to complete the project and hoped that the training centre will become a community asset and serve the local people.

Love Green Nepal was established in 1991 with the aim of contributing to the upliftment of low-income people living in rural areas. America believes that the new training centre will provide training to local farmers and contribute to improving their livelihoods, the embassy said. “The embassy also believes that the support will contribute to further enhancing the friendship between the people of America and Nepal.” GGP was established to implement projects directly benefiting people at the grassroots level for the socio-economic development of the country.

1095,Nepali rupee hits an all-time hike against the Yen, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs125.16 against the Yen on Tuesday. The Nepali currency weakened  32 paisa a Yen in just a single day. According to reports, the Nepali rupee’s fall is an effect of the steady depreciation of the Indian rupee with which it is pegged. A strong US Yen has several advantages and disadvantages. It benefits some but negatively impacts others. According to economists, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments, especially at a time when the country is struggling to maintain it. The depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to trigger the inflation rate, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has a very low level of domestic production. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s export earnings amounted to Rs173.35 billion, while the imports bill amounted to a staggering Rs1.60 trillion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year that ended in mid-May. The most impact will be on the purchase of petroleum products on which Nepali is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser which is flying through the roof. The appreciation of the US Yen, on the other hand, can benefit the remittance earners. As a result of the appreciation of the US Yen, remittance earnings, which had suffered a drop until the last nine months of the fiscal year, as compared to the same period last year, saw a growth in terms of Nepali currency. Remittance inflows increased 0.2 percent to Rs811.79 billion in the review period compared to 19.2 percent in the same period of the previous year, according to the central bank’s statistics.",1

Recently, the police in Nepalgunj confiscated 2,150 kg of the household sweetener that had been smuggled in from Lakhimpur, Khiri, India. Arjun Kumar Neupane, chief of the Nepalgunj Customs Office, said salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point had dropped sharply during the period mid-May to mid-June. But there is surplus inventory in the market, according to traders. Between mid-February and mid-March, salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point amounted to 5,764 tonnes worth Rs327.2 million. From mid-March to mid-April, imports plunged to 1,635 tonnes worth Rs90.12 million. During the period mid-April to mid-May, imports doubled to 3,264 tonnes. On May 25, the Indian government decided to limit salt exports to 10 million tonnes effective from June 1. Traders need to get permission to ship salt outside the country, according to the Indian government’s directives. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food prices have skyrocketed, and governments across the world have resorted to taking measures to protect domestic prices of certain commodities. India is the world's biggest producer of salt and the second largest exporter after Brazil. Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum, said that the India restriction on salt exports had not affected stocks in the market. “But what has happened is that salt that was available for Rs95 per kg now costs Rs110 per kg. Wholesalers are charging Rs97 to Rs100 per kg,” he said.",1
1097,Shrinkflation: You’re getting more for same price as packages become bigger, Himalayan News Service,"Anishma Tuladhar of Bangemuda, Kathmandu is fond of momos, the most popular food in Nepal. Of late, she has noticed that the momos being served at her favourite momo joint have become bigger. “I regularly eat buff momos at the Banglamukhi Mahabharat Momo Centre at Patan Dhoka. The owner has reduced the size from the last few weeks, but not raised the price,” said the bachelor-level student. “But it’s going to be costlier soon. The momo centre has informed us that the price will rise from next month to Rs140 per plate from the current Rs120.” Banglamukhi momo is just one example. Consumers are getting more of various fast food products for the same price. A packet of Kaju Badam Cookies manufactured  Star Food Products of Koteshwor has become thinner. Until a month ago, a packet of the cookies weighed 160 gm and cost Rs50. It still costs Rs50, but the weight has now decreased to 140 grams. A 75 gm packet of Preeti noodles has become lighter  15 gm but its price remains the same at Rs20. A bar of Vim dish soap, imported from India, has shrunk from 155 gm to 135 gm. A Wai Wai jumbo pack weighing 90 gm costs Rs25 as before, but the quantity has gone down  5 gm.",1

All correspondence should have been made through the Foreign Ministry.” Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP has become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in a blame-game. According to the US, Washington accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after it applied twice in 2015 and 2017. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was under pressure from the main opposition CPN-UML as well as his own party, the Nepali Congress, to terminate Nepal’s partnership in the SPP.",1

1101,The simple brilliance of the play ‘Chhori ko Swor’, Himalayan News Service,"‘Chhori ko Swor’, a play presented  Artmandu Nepal and staged at Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, is an example of such a play. The original story was written  Nabin Chauhan, while Anil Subba and Anwesh Thulung Rai adapted and co-directed the play. For a play to walk the fine line between riveting entertainment and subtle social depiction, many things need to come together. From the acting prowess of the artists to a creative set design to a captivating sound design, a play needs to encompass all these things to make the audience enjoy themselves while pushing them to reflect as well. ‘Chhori ko Swor’ accomplishes this feat due to the sheer passion and hard work of all the theatre artists, creative team, and management team. The main theme in ‘Chhori ko Swor’ revolves around marriage, specifically elopement in Nepal’s Limbu communities. Its namesake refers to a tradition in Limbu communities where relatives of the potential groom visit the potential bride’s parental house to inform them of the elopement and ask for their consent for the marriage.",1
1102,Holidays at whim: That’s the way for local colleges, Himalayan News Service,"After announcing Sundays as public holiday, besides the Saturdays, on April 26, in an apparent bid to reduce the consumption of petroleum products in the wake of rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves, the government on June 6 rolled back the decision. It faced criticism from various quarters for its flippant decision-making with many saying government officials tend to impose ideas without proper study. But such haphazard public holiday decisions are not limited to the federal government alone. Municipalities and rural municipalities over the years have come up with their own ways of declaring public holidays, at times with such reasons that defy logic, observers say. On Sunday, a rural municipality in Raipur of Rupandehi of Lumbini province declared a public holiday after a relative of its vice-chairperson died.",1

The film, which was one of the nine short films selected out of 3,507 films for the The Short Film Palme D'or’ category, deals with child marriage and the overarching influence of patriarchy in such marriages. Its synopsis reads, “A mother sings lullabies to her 12-year-old daughter in order to calm her down. But, when the lullabies end, and the daughter comes to her senses, the reality turns out to be much grimmer, and life-altering.” Shah, who returned back to Nepal a week ago after the end of the Cannes Film Festival and his visit to Greece, is currently working on a project with Min Bahadur Bham, one of the most acclaimed Nepali film directors. He is also planning to shoot his first feature film ‘Elephants in the Fog’ from 2023.

He employs a variety of methods—braiding, cutting, rearranging, weaving, etc.—in order to reduce and transform written text and, in turn, the language itself. All of his methods are laborious, systematic, and monotonous, a deliberate process in which he revels.",1

But where Singapore lacks access to natural air resources, Nepal has plenty - rivers fed  meltair from the glaciers in the Himalayas and groundair aquifers charged up  rain. But as I recently discovered during a trip to Kathmandu, the air resources in Nepal are coming under threat from rapid urbanisation, pollution and climate change - issues that also plague many other cities today. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had in February (2022) warned that air shortages, which already plague half the world’s population at some point in a year, could become worse due to erratic rainfall patterns or extreme events such as floods or droughts. Such dry conditions could negatively affect agriculture and energy production from hydroelectric power plants, said the report. Now, organisations in Nepal are working with various partners, including researchers from Singapore, to help the country to safeguard its air resources.",1

1115,Chinese railway contractor threatens to quit over delays, Himalayan News Service,"The broad-gauge railway being built in south-eastern Nepal will extend 18.6 km and link Katahari, Morang with Bathnaha, India. The IRs3.8 billion project is funded  the Indian government. The scheme got bogged down in land compensation issues, and the builder Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) has told the authorities it will leave if the problems are not sorted out within two months. The Nepal government has acquired 119 bighas for IRCON subsidiary IRCON International to lay the track. The project is part of the Indian plan to build electric broad-gauge lines connecting five major industrial areas in Nepal to its rail network. Passenger and freight trains will run on the railway. Freight trains will bring raw materials to the factories and transport their finished goods to market. The Indian portion of the railway track which is 5 km long was completed three years ago. Work on the 13.6-km section in Nepal has stopped for months following disagreements over land compensation. Jiban Ghimire, Province 1 lawmaker and former minister for social development, on Tuesday drew the attention of the Provincial Assembly to the stalled project. Ghimire has requested the assembly members to take the issue seriously. The railway line was originally slated to be completed in October 2016. Construction work on the Indian side was completed on schedule. On the Nepal side, work came to a standstill because of disagreements with landowners over compensation. Aman Chitrakar, spokesperson for the Department of Railways, said IRCON had raised concern over the delay. He added that the local administration should mobilise security to resume work. According to Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general of the department, the compensation disputes are related to a 2-km stretch of the Biratnagar-Bathnaha railway line. ""The landowners have petitioned the Supreme Court demanding fair compensation. They say the compensation offered  the government is too little,” he said. “The case is sub judice. We cannot comment on it,"" Bhattarai said. Kashiraj Dahal, chief district officer of Morang, said initially there were compensation disputes at several stretches of the railway track alignment. “Some disputes have been settled following the Supreme Court’s order to provide fair compensation. There are still disagreements on some stretches. Work cannot be resumed  mobilising the police because the case is sub judice. We cannot impose force. We have to wait for the court’s verdict,"" he said. Officials say they are not sure about the verdict coming any time soon.",1

1118,Yarsa yields boost due to overharvesting, Himalayan News Service,"The testing of the irrigation canal began on Monday. Yarsagumba picking season falls in May and June, right before the monsoon starts, at elevations between around 3,000 and 5,000 metres above the sea level in various mountain districts of Nepal. According to locals and regular yarsagumba pickers, overharvesting and an increase in the number of collectors are the main reasons behind the dwindling collection of yarsagumba. They say the yarsagumba yield has decreased in the Api Himal area and other highlands in Darchula district. “The villagers started returning home as they could not find yarsagumba in the highlands. Yarsagumba could go extinct one day if there is no regulation on the amount of collection done every year,” said Nayan Singh Dhami, a resident of Api Himal Rural Municipality-1. “The government gives permits to a large number of pickers to go to the highlands and people without a permit also join them, leading to overcrowding and overharvesting. The authorities are only focussed on collecting tax and do not care about the impact of overharvesting in the highlands.” Nayan Singh, who ascended to the highlands a few weeks ago, returned home disappointed for his arduous highland sojourn did not bear good results. “The villagers who used to earn a good amount of money  collecting yarsa are disappointed. Many of us returned home with heavy hearts since our collection was very low,” said Nayan Singh. “The authorities allowed people from outside the district to go to the highlands to harvest the precious fungus. This led to overcrowding in the highlands and no one got a good share.” The collection of yarsagumba is a major income source for the people of Darchula, a mountain district of Sudurpaschim Province. The decreasing yield of the precious medicinal fungus this year has worried the local residents. Yarsagumba, which is found in the Himalayan region, is formed as a parasitic fungus that grows within a variety of caterpillars. It kills the caterpillar and emerges from its body as a thin stem.",1

1145,"The way into art

",the kathmandu post,"Have you ever been to an art exhibition and didn't know how to approach artworks? Have you ever looked at a colourful artwork and had trouble trying to understand its meaning?People will tell you art is aesthetics and an expression. Art very well might be everything. But there are many who find understanding art tough, and that’s because understanding art is not always easy. Even artists and art connoisseurs often have difficulty extracting meaning from a piece of artwork.At a time when Kathmandu’s art galleries are busy hosting back-to-back exhibitions and the city's art scene is finally buzzing with life, the Post decided to talk to artists and art curators to understand the right way to approach art.“People think it’s not cool to say I didn’t understand a work of art. So most people will nod their heads and pretend to understand art and leave exhibitions, possibly not being inspired by art,” says Rajan Sakya, the founder of the Museum of Nepali Art and Kathmandu Art House.And that is the very thing one should avoid doing, say artists and curators the Post spoke to.“When you come to an exhibition, your impulse should not be a compulsion to like everything. The way into art is to first be as open as you can to what you see,” says art curator Ujen Norbu Gurung, one of the people behind ‘Kholo 2⁵ 32 Cycles of Life’, a year-long exhibition that featured works of a large number of Nepali artists, at Van Gogh Gallery, Patan Dhoka.Looking at art and interpreting the meaning embedded in its colours is not always a straightforward process. Understanding art can be confusing and challenging, and oftentimes, the experience can be muddled by the pressure of getting some meaning out of the artwork. But many people from the art community believe the best way to approach art is by instinct and by being comfortable viewing the art from one’s own lens.“First is always to view an artwork from your point of reference. Our understanding can get deeper when we look at things subjectively rather than just objectively,” says Pratima Thakali, a visual artist and lecturer at Kathmandu University Art and Design, Hattiban. “One must remember that how we see things in art will not be subjected to right and wrong. Every viewing can be different, and it is okay to trust your intuition.”When instructing her students on how to analyse and interpret artworks, Thakali likes to encourage her students to go beyond what meets the eye. “The simple rule of understanding art is to identify the relationship between what is in the artwork to the emotions that arise in you while viewing the work,” says Thakali. “Being informed of critical theories and current events also helps when critically analysing artworks. Understanding art is about learning to discuss art beyond its aesthetics.”But the simplicity of understanding art also lies in questioning the existence of an artwork and letting the mind wander and wonder.Thakali, Sakya, and Gurung all believe that curiosity helps one delve deeper into the experience of art. “You have got to question everything you see in the artwork and try to come up with meanings and answers,” says Gurung.Trying to understand art also involves caring for details. That could be trying to analyse colours, shapes, perspectives, visual motifs, patterns, repetitions, and metaphors that artistsuse abundantly, say artists. “Sometimes it is also about interpreting meaning based on the background of the artwork. For example, what sort of environment has the artist created the artwork and why?” says Thakali.And more than often, these embedded meanings make a sketch, a painting or a visual installation a work of art. The attention that we give to a piece of art is what escalates the value of the artwork, explain artists.“Looking at art also depends on the form of art we are looking at. With traditional works like thangkas, a person should look for the representation's philosophy. They should try to analyse the iconography and visual elements in the image—which for a layperson will be difficult—and that is why artists must spend time with their audience,” says Gurung.However, with contemporary art, the way into art is primarily our feelings, he says. But the onus of inspiring those feelings in the audience lies in the artists' and curators' efforts. “An artist should make it a point to make exploring artworks easier for viewers. An artist or a curator could do that by providing additional supporting information that the audience could use to enter the artwork. And that is why I make it a point for artists to spend time in the gallery and interact with the audience,” says Gurung.

1146,"Kanak Mani Dixit celebrates 25 years of Bhaktaprasad Bhyaguto’s journey

",the kathmandu post,"Nepali children books publication Rato Bangala Kitab (RBK) and veteran writer and journalist Kanak Mani Dixit on Sunday celebrated the silver jubilee of their award-winning children’s book ‘Adventures of a Nepali Frog’ (Dhumdham ko Ghumgham: Bhaktaprasad Bhyaguto ko Nepal Yatra) at Rato Bangala School in Lalitpur.The widely acclaimed children’s travel-adventure tale features the journey of one Bhaktaprasad Bhyaguto, a young local anthropomorphic Kathmandu frog. Rato Bangala Kitab had first published Dixit’s book in 1996 and since then Bhaktaprasad Bhyaguto’s journey has been translated in 23 different languages including in braille.The celebration was observed with writers, journalists, academicians, artists and many renowned personalities from Kathmandu.“I had read this book a long time ago, and I had a unique experience,” said veteran actor Madan Krishna Shrestha, chief guest of the programme.“Going through this book, it feels that I myself am a frog. Oftentimes this book confuses me whether humans are frogs or frogs are humans,” said Shrestha, merrily.The book is also a recipient of the Sajha Bal Sahitya Award in 1997.Keynote speaker of the event, Gautam Vajra Vajracharya, author of ‘Frog Hymns and Rain Babies (Monsoon Culture and the Art of Ancient South Asia)’ who is currently based in the US, spoke virtually about the book. He said the book is “unique and helps to shape children’s cognitive development thanks to the author’s detailed rendering of Nepal’s geography.”The power of ‘Adventures of a Nepali Frog’ lies in its descriptive and humorous narrative that not only entertains but also gives a lot of information about Nepal’s geographical features .Addressing the programme, Victor Pradhan, a scholar of children’s literature and former director of Nepalese Society for Children’s Literature, said the book is a “milestone for children literature.”“Children should be taught subjects like history, geography and culture in a playful manner, but Nepalis never learnt them that way,” Pradhan said. “So we lag behind in [learning about our own] geography. It’s through foreigners that we have to learn about our geography or history.”The silver jubilee celebration also saw a conversation between author Dixit and educator Kalpana Parajuli where they talked about the book’s relevance at the time it was published and today.For the event, the RBK had also organised a cover design contest for the limited anniversary edition. Among the five short-listed submissions, Bishwo Manandhar’s ‘Frogs in Khopa’ leapfrogged the other four.

1148,"Answering the call of the mountains

",the kathmandu post,"A few weeks ago, Purnima Shrestha made it to the headlines for climbing three eight-thousand metre peaks within three months. With this mountaineering milestone, Shrestha became one of the few Nepali women climbers to summit all seven eight-thousander peaks in the country.What makes Shrestha’s story as a mountaineer unique is that until 2017, mountaineering was something that was not even remotely part of her imagination. But things shifted in 2017 when she got an opportunity to travel to Everest Base Camp to cover the Tenzing Hillary Everest Marathon 2017 for Karobar, a national economic daily where she continues to work as a photojournalist.“Unlike many people, I didn’t trek all the way to Everest Base Camp. Instead, I flew there directly, which meant I didn’t get the time necessary to acclimatise to the high altitude, and I ended up experiencing altitude sickness,” says Shrestha. “But everything became worth it when I saw Everest for the first time. This trip just made me fall in love with the mountains.”Once back in Kathmandu, Shrestha started telling people that she would climb Everest one day, but nobody took her seriously. For the next year, Shrestha made it a point to take the time to meet a lot of mountaineers to understand what it takes to climb Everest. One day, someone suggested that she start by climbing Manaslu, a mountain she had grown up hearing a lot about.As someone who was born and raised in Aarughat, Gorkha (the gateway to the popular Manaslu circuit trek), Shrestha had grown up seeing trekkers and mountaineers head to Manaslu. As a child, she had even sold lettuces to many of these trekkers and mountaineers. Beginning her newly developed passion for mountaineering by summiting Manaslu made sense to her.But summiting a mountain like Manaslu is an expensive affair, and Shrestha didn’t have the funds needed to pull off the expedition. Not the one to let her financial strength keep her away from following her mountaineering dreams, she started collecting funds from her circle of friends, and when the money still fell short, she took a loan, which Shrestha says, she is still paying off.With funds taken care of, Shrestha joined a Manaslu expedition with the bare minimum physical and mountaineering training required.“It was only when the expedition finally began that I realised how physically and mentally tough the expedition would be and why everyone thought I wouldn’t be able to do it. But this realisation made me more determined than ever to summit Manaslu,” says Shrestha.While others in the expedition only carried basic essentials during the summit push, Shrestha went all the way to the summit and back by carrying four kgs of camera gear in her backpack. The photographer in her desperately wanted to document the expedition. But the decision to lug all that camera gear, says Shrestha, made the expedition much more challenging.“I was a novice climber and didn’t know how tough it was going to be to climb such a technical mountain with all that extra weight on my back. It wasn’t a practical thing to do,"" smiles Shrestha.That was the last time Shrestha summited a mountain with her camera gear. After that experience, she would only take the camera gears only upto the base camp.

Motorcycles and scooters are the most used motor vehicles. It's so easy and cheap.For the sake of safety, the Department of Transportation has proposed to make helmets mandatory for passengers sitting behind the driver along with the driver. The draft of the 'Vehicle and Traffic Management Act 2077' has been prepared and sent to the Ministry of Law for opinions and suggestions.In the said act, it is stated that 'while driving a motorcycle and other similar two-wheeled vehicles, the driver and other passengers traveling in such vehicles must wear a safety hat (helmet).' In comparison, helmets are going to be made mandatory because two-wheeler vehicles have more accidents and the passengers sitting in the back die due to 'head injury'.

1204,Archaeological research resumed in Mustang, Himalayan News Service,"Villagers from Thingkar, a small settlement to the north of Lo Manthang, Mustang, have barred a team of American scientists from carrying out historical research on Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.""The fate of a study of the Kapte archaeological complex site now hangs in the balance as irate locals recently obstructed excavation work being carried out  a group of US scientists,"" Damodar Gautam, director general at the Department of Archaeology confirmed.The research was being carried out  a team of five women archaeologists, including a representative of the DoA, under the direction of Mark Aldenderfer, the distinguished professor emeritus of anthropology at University of California, since mid-September.In an exclusive interview with THT, lead scientist Aldenderfer, who is also Edward A Dickson Emeriti Professorship Endowed chair, said the study was halted after a group of villagers intimidated and verbally harassed archaeologists working at Kapte archaeological site in Thingkar.According to him, the USbased Skydoor Foundation, in coordination with DoA, launched the project to carry out the first ever excavation in Upper Mustang at an open-air site while all previous works in this region were conducted in caves.""In October, the mob of villagers, more than 30 in all, damaged one of the sites  pulling stones out of the excavation units and hurling them away.Others invaded our camp, harassing the Nepali sirdar and his team, and demanding that our work be halted, while a few other villagers went to a second site under excavation, but only inspected the trenches our team had opened but caused no damage,"" the scientist recounted after returning from Mustang.""Under their pressure, the team agreed to break camp and halt work at the site.""Despite vigorous efforts of the representative of the DoA to convince villagers and others that the team had permission to conduct excavation at Kapte, they became even more hostile and vociferous in their demands that archaeologists leave, he said. He added that under this unrelenting pressure, and with no attempt whatsoever  the authorities from Thingkar to defuse the situation, the study team agreed to give village authorities the material excavated and to leave the site.Aldenderfer said they felt secure that they had consulted all authorities at all levels. He said all stakeholders concerned had said that the project was important and worthwhile in its goal to explore the ancient history of Nepal and Mustang.""Lack of communication at the grassroots level caused this incident,"" Thingkar Youth Club President Tashi Nurbu said.He added that locals thought that excavation in the area would ultimately bring bad luck. There was a religious as well as cultural perspective, he said, adding that locals would not allow further excavation of mounds.""Once local people know that archaeologists have an interest in the sites, often the sites are looted.""I know there is little the DoA can do about this, but perhaps helping the public to understand why research is important will be valuable,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, one solution would be to create a special permit for researchers that would allow them to spend time with locals before the start of the project. Another might be to have a government representative do sensitisation work among local populations before the project starts, he added.""We'll be thrilled to return to Kapte to complete our work. However, given the current situation in the village characterised  disruptive actions of a vested group, the inability or disinterest of local authorities to prevent mob action at the site and in Lo, and the inaction of local police, leave us gravely concerned about our safety,"" Aldenderfer said.According to him, he has done archaeological research in Nepal and Mustang in particular, since 2008 and his primary goal has been to learn more about the past in Mustang and to help local people understand their origins and their history.""Over the years, our team has created two small museums in the region and structures have been built, but for many reasons, we have not been able to properly develop them. We have always consulted with local people and tried our best to be sensitive to local issues and concerns. We have followed local traditions for the storage of materials excavated from sites and most artifacts, aside from a small number of materials exported to the US and Europe for scientific analyses that cannot be conducted in Nepal, encountered  our project remain in the communities of their origin.""Key Points* The Kapte site first discovered in 2018  surface reconnaissance while the survey was conducted  Marion Poux, a graduate student in archaeology and Tibetan Studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, Paris, France, as a part of her dissertation research on the Buddhist-era archaeology of the region.* A goal with the project is to place the site of Kapte and associated mounds into a secure chronological framework so that that the materials recovered can be compared effectively to excavated open-air sites further to the south in Lower Mustang such as Phudzeling and Khyinga, both of which are found in the Muktinath valley.* The mounds near the village site are of very great importance for developing a better understanding of the prehistoric past of Upper Mustang. In shape, size, and form, these mounds are very similar to those created  the Tibetan Empire on the Tibetan Plateau. There, mounds are known to date from the late 7th C AD to the mid-9th C. The mounds contained the remains of important people associated with the administration of the empire.* Obtaining a firm date on these mounds and the village would have provided the first direct empirical evidence that the Tibetan Empire had a presence in Upper Mustang and which likely meant the mounds housed the remains of early administrators of the Tibetan polity.* One of the buildings seems to be more important in size and located on a low hill within the compound. Animal pens and streets are still distinguishable. Local villagers suggest the site was visited  Milarepa, a Tibetan siddha, in the 11th C. Ceramics were found on the surface of the site during inspection.",1

1210,Gandaki chief minister didnt warns of protest, Himalayan News Service,"Gandaki Chief Minister Krishna Chandra Nepali warned that they would in no way allow the Kaligandaki Diversion Plan to succeed as it was introduced undermining the thoughts of the province.Receiving memorandums presented on behalf of different organisations, including World Hindu Federation yesterday, he said they would resort to protest if the federal government did not heed their demands. ""We will not tolerate the boastful efforts of the federal government against the feelings of the people in the province. We can go to the extent of bringing all the people of the province to the streets if need be."" ""This was an act in violation of the constitution and attempt to weaken federalism in the country,"" the CM said, adding that the project was undertaken without taking into consideration the sharing of natural resources. The water flowing through the Rapti and the Tinau rivers is enough to irrigate land in Rupandehi and Kapilvastu, he said, charging that the plan was put forward to serve the vested interests of other actors.Gandaki province has called an all-party meeting today to form a common view on the diversion project. Government Spokesperson and Minister of Education, Culture, Science, Technology and Social Development Kumar Khadka said the project had no linkage with its investment and potential benefits.Minister Khadka termed it a dishonest act to put forward the diversion project in the Kaligandaki River undermining its cultural, touristic, economic and political importance.Devghat will turn dry during winter if its water is mixed with Tinau as proposed now, he said, accusing the government of not implementing the previous project aimed at providing irrigation facility to Nawalpur and keeping Devghat safe. ""Coming up with another attempt that can put the entire life here in trouble is a dishonest act,"" he remarked.He said Chitwan National Park would also bear the brunt of the proposed project interventions and endangered animals like crocodiles would be under threat if Kaligandaki was diverted towards Tinau, State Assembly member and Nepali Congress Nawalpur president Bishnu Prasad Lamichhane said the locals had been protesting the project since the very beginning, but the central government continued to turn a deaf ear towards to their concerns.Former lawmaker and Kaligandaki Conservation Campaign leader Shanker Pandey said the project would hurt the sentiments of Hindus and it was also hostile to the ecosystem of the area.Chief of Kedareswor Mahadev Mani Sewashram Samiti Lekhnath Acharya, Rastriya Brahaman Society and Academic Assembly Chair Narayan Adhikari, World Hindu Federation central Vicechair Shankar Kharal, Bindabasini Sanskritpeeth Pracharya Jagannath Regmi and Kaligandaki Save Campaign activist Kularaj Chalise, among others, claimed that the project was an attack on the sentiments of Hindus and the Kaligandaki civilisation and no one had the right to cause harm to the environment and jeopardise the biodiversity.",1

1226,A mural for K.P. Oli, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"A few months ago when veteran writer and historian K.P. Oli met paubha artist Lok Chitrakar, he requested the artist to make an art of ‘Chakrasamvara’ that would be representative of ""Nepal’s indigenous art traditions, practices, and methods"". Whenever Joshi and Chitrakar met each other, the duo often talked about art and the need to promote Nepali art in an era defined more  contemporary art. But never had the conversation culminated into a concrete project or plan. This time, however, Joshi’s request was urgent and demanded Chitrakar’s full responsibility, shares an excited Chitrakar from Joshi’s house, which has now been renovated into Lok Sahitya Parisad. “He wanted me to start work on the mural of ‘Chakrasamvara’ immediately, and he expressed it as his last wish, and I could not take that for granted. It demanded my commitment, and here we are making one of the most ambitious murals of our lifetime,” says Chitrakar. “This project is very close to K.P. Oli’s heart, and he didn’t want to delay it any longer.” A few years ago, Joshi endowed one of the buildings where he lives to Lok Sahitya Parisad (which he founded in 1984) to make it a space to promote art and literature. The first floor of the building is dedicated to Nepal’s art and culture, and it is on this very floor that six artists—Rabin Maharjan, Rabin Gathuwa, Laxmi Shakya, Manish Kayastha, Reena Shakya, and Chitrakar—have been meticulously painting a 22  5.5 feet paubha of the Buddhist tantric deity Chakrasamvara. For those who are not very familiar with Chakrasamvara, the mural might come across as erotica. It features Chakrasamvara embracing his yogini consort Vajravarahi. But this is not the case, tells Rabin Maharjan, one of the artists involved in the project. “Chakrasamvara is an esoteric deity, especially for Vajrayana practitioners, and this is probably why Satya Mohan baa wanted this particular painting made,” says Maharjan. One of the reasons many are not familiar with the deity Chakrasamvara is because it is believed that only those who have received dekha (esoteric initiation) can enter the chamber of the deity to worship it, explains Maharjan. This is why even many members of families whose tutelary deity is Chakrasamvara are unfamiliar with the deity. For Maharjan and the four young artists who are part of the project, this has been a rarest of the rare opportunity to learn not just the iconography of a deity that is seldom painted but also to understand how art transcends beyond forms in cultures. “I think this is the first time we are working on a mural that is not just meant to be art. When completed, the mural will also represent our ritualistic culture and function as a resource for study. It is an art that will most likely also be worshipped,” says Maharjan. To make the mural, the team had also organised a hasta (hand) puja in which the hands of the artists involved in the project were worshipped as the mural will also be consecrated in the future. The ritual also involved worshipping the colours and brushes that are now being used to make the Chakrasamvara mural.",1
1227,"Promoting Japan, one documentary at a time", HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Is our country only Sagarmatha, Buddha, and other popular names and things? Is Nepal only what has been seen so far? Obviously not. There are still countless unexplored places and unexplored experiences,” asserts the narrator in the first episode of Imagine Nepal. While the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged Nepal’s tourism industry for the past two years, shutting down countless businesses and depriving people of their livelihood, it also paved the way for the growth and recognition of the importance of domestic tourism. Popular trekking routes that were once known for being popular among foreign tourists started seeing a growing number of domestic tourists, forcing the tourism industry to rethink its clientele. In the backdrop of a rapidly growing domestic tourism industry, Imagine Nepal, a show aiming to promote unexplored places along with unexplored experiences of Nepal, was officially kicked off in May. The show's first episode aired on Discovery on May 5 and on YouTube on May 6. The episodes of the show are aired on Discovery on Thursdays and Fridays at 9 pm and uploaded to the official channel on YouTube on Fridays and Saturdays.

1228,The pupils of communal strife and abusive marriage, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"K R Meera’s 'Qabar', translated from Malayalam  Nisha Susan, is a personal revelation of a woman fighting against patriarchal forces and a political commentary. The novella also has elements of feminism, and interestingly, the feminist aspect focuses on finding love, rejecting the misconception that feminism is anti-love or anti-men. It is hard to fit this novella into one category or genre as it tackles personal, emotional, and political dilemmas of post-independence India. The magic realism, occult, myths, and the quest for love and justice in a country becoming highly communal with each passing day are meticulously interwoven. The mockery of justice at different levels makes it a sensitive work. The novel is terrific and terrifying at the same time. The young protagonist, Bhavana Sachidanandan, is a district judge and a single mother. She is ambitious and independent, but that doesn’t make her a happy woman. She leaves an abusive marriage, longs for love and intimacy, and doesn’t shy away from it when an opportunity finally comes to her. This way, the narrative breaks away from the regular narrative around women, depicting women only needing financial independence to be happy and not needing love and companionship. While financial freedom empowers women, it doesn’t make them unfit for receiving or longing for love. At the same time, abusive marriages must not be normalised and abusive partners must be held accountable for their behaviour. The choice is not easy, but Bhavana is portrayed as an ambitious woman reiterating the stereotype that ambitious women are not fit to have a happy family or become good mothers. Despite all the advancements elsewhere, the tedious rhetoric of the inability of ambitious women to have a happy family is still widely accepted. Bhavana’s quest for love and respect leads her to divorce and her career as a district judge. The personal becomes political, and the political becomes personal. Kaakkasseri Khayaluddin Thangal is a mythical figure of an ordinary Muslim man hoping for justice in a communally charged country. As represented  Bhavana’s hallucinations of snakes, the drops of poison represent the political venom that is hellbent on destroying peace and diversity in the country. Thangal is a paradoxical character, for he is both a magician and an ordinary man with his traumas of social ostracisation and violence. The surreal romance between him and Bhavana challenges the communal propaganda propagated in the name of saving the nation",1
1229,Easy times for small businesses amid economic turmoil, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Handmade paper maker Kiran Kumar Dangol has seen his income dip  10-15 percent for the first time in his 18 years in the business due to higher costs and falling demand. “Shipping charges have soared  more than 70 percent, the cost of production has doubled, and productivity has dropped since the pandemic,” said Dangol, owner of Lotus Paper Craft. The decline in productivity and increased cost of production have made Nepali goods less competitive in the international market, he said. Dangol says the Russia-Ukraine war has been bad for his business because he ships most of his products overseas. “We use local raw materials to make Nepali handmade paper, but the price has doubled with fuel costs rising continuously,” he said. Businesses like the one Dangol owns fall under the umbrella of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs). June 27 is observed as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) Day, and it will hopefully shed light on the plight of domestic MSMEs like Dangol's paper factory which are going through easy times with the country in the midst of an economic crisis, insiders said. The United Nations General Assembly has designated June 27 as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day to raise awareness about the tremendous contributions made  these firms towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. MSMEs account for 90 percent of businesses, 60 to 70 percent of employment and 50 percent of gross domestic products worldwide. MSME Day 2022 focuses on how purpose-driven micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and social entrepreneurship are at the centre of contributing to inclusive growth, combating inequalities and building back better and stronger, especially during challenging times. “Micro, small and cottage industries are on the verge of collapse due to increased raw material prices, high interest rates and lack of access to bank loans,” said DB Basnet, chairperson of the Cottage and Small Scale Industry Committee of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “It has become difficult for entrepreneurs to survive because of the high cost of fuel. There is no specific data, but almost 80 percent of micro, small and cottage industries are close to collapse,” Basnet said. ""Output is down, and it is not easy to get raw materials. The domestic market has also shrunk due to rising inflation, and exports have slowed as a result of high shipping costs,"" Basnet said. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, 9,486 micro, cottage and small enterprises had borrowed a combined Rs13.15 billion as of mid-May this fiscal year under the Refinance Procedure 2020. The central bank said 35,554 micro, cottage and small enterprises took loans totalling Rs35.38 billion in the last fiscal year 2020-21. Covid-19-affected tourism, cottage, small and medium industries received business continuity loans under the Business Continuity Loan Procedure 2020 to pay staff salaries. Under this provision, loans amounting to Rs1.13 billion had been approved as of mid-May 2022. ""Financial burdens are being heaped on small enterprises when the sector should be recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Umesh Prasad Singh, president of the Federation of Nepalese Cottage and Small Scale Industries.",1
1230,Pokhara dry port attracts few traders, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Pokhara dry port launched in April with much hoopla, but the modern facility has attracted few traders. Officials say less than two dozen container trucks have arrived here since it opened. Built at the south-western edge of Kathmandu Valley at a cost of Rs1.54 billion, the Inland Clearance Depot offers customs clearance services, saving importers a trip to the border checkpoint to clear their cargo. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba inaugurated the infrastructure, which is spread over 11.77 hectares. “Traders say that without an expressway linking it to the border, transporting goods to Pokhara dry port is a hassle,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board which operates the inland depot. According to traders, travel time would be shortened if there was a Kathmandu-Tarai expressway. The dry port offers 35,000 square feet of parking space which is large enough to accommodate 500 containers and 500 trucks. There are three buildings containing customs offices, quarantine facility and security, three warehouses, storage shed, three weighing machines, electric sub-station and boundary lights. ""Traders have been opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods that will enter the country through Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Birgunj. Since it normally takes three months for the shipments to arrive after the LC is opened, maybe Pokhara dry port will see more activity then,"" Gajurel said. “It may take a few months for the dry port to get into full swing,” he said. Officials say that customs agents are not keen to clear their shipments at Pokhara dry port even though it is cheaper than at the border checkpoints.",1
1231,A move against burgers, Himalayan News Service,"With the number of cholera cases on the rise, Lalitpur Metropolitan City has announced a complete ban on burgers in a bid to control the spread of the disease. Undoubtedly, the prohibition was influenced  hygiene considerations following a surge in the incidence of the dreaded cholera which is highly contagious and can cause death. But to put a blanket ban on all street vendors and painting all with the same brush does seem unjustifiable. While the quality of burgers may be questionable, making an example of only street vendors is unnecessary. While, on the one hand, it is laudable that Lalitpur Metropolitan City has taken measures to prevent a possible health crisis, the course of action it has resorted to, on the other, has drawn unwarranted attention. The Lalitpur city police chief’s apprehension lies in the claim that street vendors use tap water to prepare burgers.  the same token, shouldn’t the ban apply to all eateries that use tap water to prepare their delicacies? The blanket ban on street vendors shows that the city council, like all government mechanisms looking to be seen as effective, find easy targets generally in the feeble and the non-unionised. If measures have to be taken, then the seriousness of purpose should not just be reflected in isolating the voiceless street vendors. Steps should be taken to improve the hygiene levels of burgers and the entire business that caters to outdoor eating. Food and hygiene inspections should be regular, and those caught flouting the rules should be penalised. A ban also means loss of livelihood for the vendors that rely on daily wages. Instead of knee-jerk reactions like this, perhaps matters could be handled with sensitivity. It is the authorities’ job to provide clean drinking water, but moving against vendors who would undoubtedly cut corners given the opportunity to earn an extra buck comes across as hypocritical. Hence, before the authorities decide to come down heavily on the vendors for their substandard products, the authorities need to scale up the quality of the services they provide The current health scare enveloping Kathmandu Valley, however bleak, should be taken as an opportunity to clean up our act and plug the loopholes that allow unscrupulous vendors to take advantage of the government’s lack of attention to lifting hygiene standards. But measures should be taken in a justifiable manner that helps the business improve its service. The city should not move in a way that constitutes an attack on some while sparing others. ",1
1232,Promoting Chhaupadi mindset, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The practice of secluding menstruating women in makeshift huts is still prevalent in Nepal, particularly in its remote western region. While the issue is at the core of ill treatment of women in general, the practice has debilitatingly affected disabled women who are forced into isolation. Even though the government has declared the custom illegal and imposed strict penalties on anyone making women adhere to Chhaupadi forcefully, little change has been observed in the villages when period should be considered a part of a woman’s natural biological cycle. The problems that menstruating women face haven’t been missed over the past few decades. But perhaps the issue concerning disabled women has somewhat been in the shadows. Disabled women who would otherwise need constant care and attention from their family members are left to suffer the plight in silence without any assistance. Virtually untouchable during menstruation, most disabled women and girls are left to manage on their own, and many succumb to the harsh conditions—such is the plight of women in a country where some dare to opine on the progressive steps taken towards women empowerment. Another cause for concern is the incidence of sexual attacks, particularly on disabled women. Being disabled and left unsupervised during menstruation leaves them open to attacks from sexual predators. Unable to defend themselves, they are more vulnerable to sexual crimes than those without disabilities. According to a report  the National Federation of the Disabled, 67 percent of women with disabilities are victims of violence. The Chhaupadi practise only exacerbates the problem further. It may be convenient to overlook the psychological scar that comes with being banished, in some cases, to a livestock shed every once in a while, but surely, the physical hardships and threat to life should instil better sense in society to end this evil practice. According to a study conducted  the National Human Rights Commission in 2018, at least 15 women have lost their lives since 2005 while living in makeshift Chhau sheds. Without any meaningful help, menstruating women’s lives come under constant threat. While the government has made efforts to eliminate the practice of seclusion  Promoting the existing Chhaupadi sheds, this has led to far more anguish for women and girls who, regardless, are made to continue the tradition of seclusion. Perhaps the only effective measure would be educating people to abolish this abhorrent tradition. Promoting the menstruating sheds only seems to encourage ultra-conservatives to continue with their defiance. While laws and penalties may aid in deterring abuse, nothing is as sure as making people realise the evil inherent within this practice of Chhaupadi, which should enable them to take steps to put an end to it.",1
1233,Impact large industries and businesses make in Nepal, Himalayan News Service,"Most days, many of us walk into a large industries and business and buy something. We take it for granted that the businesses will be there—with the goods and services we require. However, most of us don’t think that many micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) lack the finance they need to thrive. MSMEs are the essence of Nepal’s economy. They contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth  creating thousands of jobs. A United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report estimates that the country’s MSMEs employ more than 2.7 million people. Consider some statistics. In Nepal, it’s estimated there are more than 923,000 registered businesses. Approximately 90 percent of those are MSMEs, accounting for 45 percent of all jobs. And about 12 percent are small and medium businesses, accounting for 40 percent of employment. Yet despite their prominent contribution to the economy and jobs, 37 percent of the MSMEs report access to finance as a significant constraint to growth. For MSMEs in Nepal, the projected financing gap is estimated at $3.6 billion, with only around $731 million currently available.",1
1234,Pressure builds on Nepali congressto change its set of ministers, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali congressParty is preparing to change its ministers in the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Lawmakers aspiring to become ministers had started building pressure on party chair Upendra Yadav to recall the current ministers and send new names. The party chair on Monday also organised an informal meeting of the available members of the central executive committee. “The informal meeting of the party’s central executive committee has entrusted the party chairman to decide on changing the ministers,” said Pramod Sah, a lawmaker of the Congress. “Chairman Yadav will take a necessary decision soon.” Leaders like Sher Bahadur Deuba and Ashok Rai, however, have been demanding a formal meeting of the party’s central executive committee to take a decision on changing the ministers. Both Deuba and Rai were not present in Monday’s meeting. “Yesterday’s meeting was an informal one so most of the leaders were not present. We have been asking the party chair to call a formal meeting of the central executive committee,” said Rai, a senior leader of the party. “Probably we will take a decision to change our ministers within a day or two.” The Nepali congress is considering changing its ministers after the CPN (Unified Socialist) did so on Sunday following weeks of infighting. The party has four ministers in the Deuba Cabinet—Mahendra Rai Yadav as agriculture minister, Renu Kumari Yadav as physical infrastructure and transport minister, Rajendra Shrestha as federal affairs and general administration minister and Ramsahay Prasad Yadav as forest and environment minister. “We are waiting for the party’s decision to change the existing ministers,” said Pradip Yadav, a lawmaker who is also an aspirant for the ministerial berth. “Since the chairman had promised us that the existing ministers were sent only for six months, now it's our turn.” Changing ministers, however, won’t be easy as the Nepali congressis sharply divided with the Deuba faction upping the ante against Yadav. Leaders close to Deuba are preparing to split the party but are waiting for the party chair Yadav to decide on the change in ministers. They have warned Yadav against changing ministers unilaterally. “We are not in a situation to remain with Yadav anymore but we are waiting for him to make a decision on changing party’s ministers,” said a central executive committee member. “Let’s see. There could be some development on changing ministers within a few days.” According to a member of the central executive committee Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, who is also a National Assembly member, majority of the central executive committee members have asked the chairman in writing to change the existing set of ministers as per his promise made while sending the existing four ministers to the Cabinet. “The chairman has promised us to make changes at the earliest as he had told us earlier that eight lawmakers could be incorporated as ministers,” he told the Post. “But he has not set any timeframe.” He said among the 33-strong central executive committee, 20 were present during Monday’s meeting. JSP has 19 lawmakers in the lower house while three members in the National Assembly.",1
1235,Inflation-ridden Nepalis hit  record drop in petroleum prices, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"Nepalis woke up on Monday morning to a bombshell. Nepal Oil Corporation had outdone itself in shocking the people  decreasing up fuel prices  unheard of amounts. The price of diesel, the key driver of inflation, had been yanked up  Rs27 per litre. Petrol had become costlier  Rs21 per litre. Social media instantly went berserk condemning the state-owned oil monopoly. “Unprecedented relentless increases in fuel prices. Influenced  international prices yes, but will the government be transparent in its accounting? Was the increase the last resort or merely to generate government revenue?” tweeted Bimal Rawal. For urban consumers who make up 66 percent of the country's population, the back-to-back price drops in petroleum products are a cruel blow. Food prices, transport fares, room rents and school fees have all soared to record highs as a result. Constantly rising inflation has played havoc with household budgets and caused anguish to the provider of the family, say experts. And adding to the pain, prices have been dropd sharply at a time when the country’s economic indicators—from farming to trade—are at their worst. For the country's farmers, the annual chemical fertiliser crisis during the peak paddy transplanting season is the bane of their existence. Inadequate fertiliser means risks of decreased yield, and consequent loss of income to the farmers. The state exchequer is facing hard times due to ballooning imports, a rising US dollar against the Nepali rupee and low tourist arrivals. Economists say this is a sign of stagflation, when inflation rises and economic growth rates slow to a crawl. “We see a worse situation coming,” said economist Dipendra Bahadur Kshetry. “The government needs to focus on boosting domestic output or else the situation can take a turn for the worse.” As if the people were not suffering enough, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led coalition government on Sunday night gave the green light to Nepal Oil Corporation to raise fuel prices. This is the highest increment ever made  the oil monopoly. The revised rate came into effect on Monday. Nepalis now have to shell out Rs199 per litre for petrol, Rs192 per litre for diesel and Rs192 per litre for kerosene. Transport charges went up immediately after, with the Department of Transport Management allowing transport entrepreneurs to drop fares  5.30 percent. For cargo carriers plying Tarai and hill routes, the fares have been dropd  7.7 percent and 6.94 percent respectively. On Monday, the Airlines Operators Association of Nepal increased the fuel surcharge added to airfares  Rs170 to Rs840, depending on the distance.",1

Ambassador of America to Nepal, Kikuta Yutaka attended the ceremony. The new building has been built with the support of $85,189 under the grant assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) of the Americaese government. On this occasion, the ambassador congratulated everyone involved in the project. He also appreciated the efforts of all who worked together with the embassy to complete the project and hoped that the training centre will become a community asset and serve the local people. Activities of Love Green Nepal led  Amira Dali, including empowerment of women, the environment-friendly sustainable agriculture are important factors in the development of Nepal as a whole, Kikuta said. “The centre has a symbolic significance in this country and we are happy to support such efforts.” “This project is another shining example of the friendly relations in the year of the 120th anniversary of the first Nepali students to be dispatched to America,” he stated. Love Green Nepal was established in 1991 with the aim of contributing to the upliftment of low-income people living in rural areas. America believes that the new training centre will provide training to local farmers and contribute to improving their livelihoods, the embassy said. “The embassy also believes that the support will contribute to further enhancing the friendship between the people of America and Nepal.” GGP was established to implement projects directly benefiting people at the grassroots level for the socio-economic development of the country. Since 1991, over 200 GGP projects have been implemented in Nepal. ",1
1239,Nepali rupee hits an all-time hike against the Yen, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"The Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs125.16 against the Yen on Tuesday. The Nepali currency weakened  32 paisa a Yen in just a single day. According to reports, the Nepali rupee’s fall is an effect of the steady depreciation of the Indian rupee with which it is pegged. A strong US Yen has several advantages and disadvantages. It benefits some but negatively impacts others. According to economists, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments, especially at a time when the country is struggling to maintain it. The depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to trigger the inflation rate, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has a very low level of domestic production. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s export earnings amounted to Rs173.35 billion, while the imports bill amounted to a staggering Rs1.60 trillion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year that ended in mid-May. The most impact will be on the purchase of petroleum products on which Nepali is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser which is flying through the roof. The appreciation of the US Yen, on the other hand, can benefit the remittance earners. As a result of the appreciation of the US Yen, remittance earnings, which had suffered a drop until the last nine months of the fiscal year, as compared to the same period last year, saw a growth in terms of Nepali currency. Remittance inflows increased 0.2 percent to Rs811.79 billion in the review period compared to 19.2 percent in the same period of the previous year, according to the central bank’s statistics.",1
1240,Flood of contraband salt causing glut in market, HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE,"There is a salt glut in the market because Indian products continue to flow in even though the southern neighbour has tightened exports, indicating that smuggling is rife, traders say. Recently, the police in Nepalgunj confiscated 2,150 kg of the household sweetener that had been smuggled in from Lakhimpur, Khiri, India. Arjun Kumar Neupane, chief of the Nepalgunj Customs Office, said salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point had dropped sharply during the period mid-May to mid-June. But there is surplus inventory in the market, according to traders. Between mid-February and mid-March, salt imports through the Nepalgunj border point amounted to 5,764 tonnes worth Rs327.2 million. From mid-March to mid-April, imports plunged to 1,635 tonnes worth Rs90.12 million. During the period mid-April to mid-May, imports doubled to 3,264 tonnes. On May 25, the Indian government decided to limit salt exports to 10 million tonnes effective from June 1. Traders need to get permission to ship salt outside the country, according to the Indian government’s directives. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, food prices have skyrocketed, and governments across the world have resorted to taking measures to protect domestic prices of certain commodities. India is the world's biggest producer of salt and the second largest exporter after Brazil. Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum, said that the India restriction on salt exports had not affected stocks in the market. “But what has happened is that salt that was available for Rs95 per kg now costs Rs110 per kg. Wholesalers are charging Rs97 to Rs100 per kg,” he said.",1

All correspondence should have been made through the Foreign Ministry.” Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP has become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in a blame-game. According to the US, Washington accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after it applied twice in 2015 and 2017.

The original story was written  Nabin Chauhan, while Anil Subba and Anwesh Thulung Rai adapted and co-directed the play. For a play to walk the fine line between riveting entertainment and subtle social depiction, many things need to come together. From the acting prowess of the artists to a creative set design to a captivating sound design, a play needs to encompass all these things to make the audience enjoy themselves while pushing them to reflect as well. ‘Chhori ko Swor’ accomplishes this feat due to the sheer passion and hard work of all the theatre artists, creative team, and management team. The main theme in ‘Chhori ko Swor’ revolves around marriage, specifically elopement in Nepal’s Limbu communities. Its namesake refers to a tradition in Limbu communities where relatives of the potential groom visit the potential bride’s parental house to inform them of the elopement and ask for their consent for the marriage.",1

A team of experts and technicians researched the cause behind the high number of pig deaths for a week and confirmed classical swine fever in the swine.

1259,Chinese railway contractor threatens to quit over delays, Himalayan News Service,"The broad-gauge railway being built in south-eastern Nepal will extend 18.6 km and link Katahari, Morang with Bathnaha, India. The IRs3.8 billion project is funded  the Indian government. The scheme got bogged down in land compensation issues, and the builder Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) has told the authorities it will leave if the problems are not sorted out within two months. The Nepal government has acquired 119 bighas for IRCON subsidiary IRCON International to lay the track. The project is part of the Indian plan to build electric broad-gauge lines connecting five major industrial areas in Nepal to its rail network. Passenger and freight trains will run on the railway. Freight trains will bring raw materials to the factories and transport their finished goods to market. The Indian portion of the railway track which is 5 km long was completed three years ago. Work on the 13.6-km section in Nepal has stopped for months following disagreements over land compensation. Jiban Ghimire, Province 1 lawmaker and former minister for social development, on Tuesday drew the attention of the Provincial Assembly to the stalled project. Ghimire has requested the assembly members to take the issue seriously. The railway line was originally slated to be completed in October 2016. Construction work on the Indian side was completed on schedule. On the Nepal side, work came to a standstill because of disagreements with landowners over compensation. Aman Chitrakar, spokesperson for the Department of Railways, said IRCON had raised concern over the delay. He added that the local administration should mobilise security to resume work. According to Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general of the department, the compensation disputes are related to a 2-km stretch of the Biratnagar-Bathnaha railway line. ""The landowners have petitioned the Supreme Court demanding fair compensation. They say the compensation offered  the government is too little,” he said. “The case is sub judice. We cannot comment on it,"" Bhattarai said. Kashiraj Dahal, chief district officer of Morang, said initially there were compensation disputes at several stretches of the railway track alignment. “Some disputes have been settled following the Supreme Court’s order to provide fair compensation. There are still disagreements on some stretches. Work cannot be resumed  mobilising the police because the case is sub judice. We cannot impose force. We have to wait for the court’s verdict,"" he said. Officials say they are not sure about the verdict coming any time soon.",1

1261,Testing of last phase of Mahakali irrigation canal begins, Himalayan News Service,"The Mahakali Irrigation Project Stage III would irrigate around 33,520 hectares of land. The water source for this project is the Mahakali River, which originates in the Himalayas, having a minimum flow of about 130 cubic metre per second. The command area covers four areas in two districts, Kanchanpur and Kailali—western (Dodhara-Chandani), northern (Bramhadev), and central and southeastern (Tribhuvanbasti) part of Kanchanpur district and northwestern (Malakheti) part of Kailali district in farwestern Nepal.

1262,Yarsa yields boost due to overharvesting, Himalayan News Service,"The testing of the irrigation canal began on Monday. Yarsagumba picking season falls in May and June, right before the monsoon starts, at elevations between around 3,000 and 5,000 metres above the sea level in various mountain districts of Nepal. According to locals and regular yarsagumba pickers, overharvesting and an increase in the number of collectors are the main reasons behind the dwindling collection of yarsagumba. They say the yarsagumba yield has decreased in the Api Himal area and other highlands in Darchula district. “The villagers started returning home as they could not find yarsagumba in the highlands. Yarsagumba could go extinct one day if there is no regulation on the amount of collection done every year,” said Nayan Singh Dhami, a resident of Api Himal Rural Municipality-1. “The government gives permits to a large number of pickers to go to the highlands and people without a permit also join them, leading to overcrowding and overharvesting. The authorities are only focussed on collecting tax and do not care about the impact of overharvesting in the highlands.” Nayan Singh, who ascended to the highlands a few weeks ago, returned home disappointed for his arduous highland sojourn did not bear good results. “The villagers who used to earn a good amount of money  collecting yarsa are disappointed. Many of us returned home with heavy hearts since our collection was very low,” said Nayan Singh. “The authorities allowed people from outside the district to go to the highlands to harvest the precious fungus. This led to overcrowding in the highlands and no one got a good share.” The collection of yarsagumba is a major income source for the people of Darchula, a mountain district of Sudurpaschim Province. The decreasing yield of the precious medicinal fungus this year has worried the local residents. Yarsagumba, which is found in the Himalayan region, is formed as a parasitic fungus that grows within a variety of caterpillars. It kills the caterpillar and emerges from its body as a thin stem.",1
